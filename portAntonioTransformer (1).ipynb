The roadside flowers, too wet for the bee, Expend their bloom in vain. Come over the hills and far with me, And be my love in the rain. The birds have less to say for themselves In the wood-worlds torn despair Than now these numberless years the elves, Although they are no less there All song of the woods is crushed like some Wild, easily shattered rose. Come, be my love in the wet woods come, Where the boughs rain when it blows. There is the gale to urge behind And bruit our singing down, And the shallow waters aflutter with wind From which to gather your gown. What matter if we go clear to the west, And come not through dry-shod For wilding brooch shall wet your breast The rain-fresh goldenrod. Oh, never this whelming east wind swells But it seems like the seas return To the ancient lands where it left the shells Before the age of the fern And it seems like the time when after doubt Our love came back amain. Oh, come forth into the storm and rout And be my love in the rain.\n",

Down on Lenox Avenue the other night By the pale dull pallor of an old gas light He did a lazy sway... He did a lazy sway... To the tune o those Weary Blues. With his ebony hands on each ivory key He made that poor piano moan with melody. O Blues Swaying to and fro on his rickety stool He played that sad raggy tune like a musical fool. Sweet Blues Coming from a black mans soul. O Blues In a deep song voice with a melancholy tone I heard that Negro sing, that old piano moan Aint got nobody in all this world, Aint got nobody but ma self. Is gwine to quit ma frownin And put ma troubles on the shelf. Thump, thump, thump, went his foot on the floor. He played a few chords then he sang some more I got the Weary Blues And I cant be satisfied. Got the Weary Blues And cant be satisfied I aint happy no mo And I wish that I had died.And far into the night he crooned that tune.The stars went out and so did the moon.The singer stopped playing and went to bedWhile the Weary Blues echoed through his head.He slept like a rock or a man that's dead. that I had died.

Living is no laughing matter you must take it seriously, so much so and to such a degree that, for example, your hands tied behind your back, your back to the wall, or else in a laboratory in your white coat and safety glasses, you can die for people even for people whose faces youve never seen, even though you know living is the most real, the most beautiful thing.

Lets say were seriously ill, need surgery which is to say we might not get up from the white table. Even though its impossible not to feel sad about going a little too soon, well still laugh at the jokes being told, well look out the window to see if its raining, or still wait anxiously for the latest newscast... Lets say were at the front for something worth fighting for, say. There, in the first offensive, on that very day, we might fall on our face, dead. Well know this with a curious anger, but well still worry ourselves to death about the outcome of the war, which could last years.

This earth will grow cold, a star among stars and one of the smallest, a gilded mote on blue velvet I mean this, our great earth. This earth will grow cold one day, not like a block of ice or a dead cloud even but like an empty walnut it will roll along in pitch-black space...

I like to work, read, learn, and understand life. I like a pipe for a Christmas present, or recordsBessie, bop, or Bach. I guess being colored doesn't make me not like the same things other folks like who are other races. So will my page be colored that I write Being me, it will not be white.

            "It is really something when a kid who has a hard time becomes a kid whos having a good time in no small part thanks to you throwing that kid in the air again and again on a mile long walk home from the Indian joint as her mom looks sideways at you like you dont need to keep doing this because youre pouring with sweat and breathing a little bit now youre getting a good workout but because the kid laughs like a horse up there laughs like a kangaroo beating her wings against the light because she laughs like a happy little kid and when coming down and grabbing your forearm to brace herself for the time when you will drop her which you dont and slides her hand into yours as she says for the fortieth time the fiftieth time inexhaustible her delight again again again and again and you say give me til the redbud tree or give me til the persimmon tree because she knows the trees and so quiet you almost cant hear through her giggles she says ok til the next tree when she explodes howling yanking your arm from the socket again again all the wolves and mourning doves flying from her tiny throat and you throw her so high she lives up there in the tree for a minute she notices the ants organizing on the bark and a bumblebee carousing the little unripe persimmon in its beret she laughs and laughs as she hovers up there like a bumblebee like a hummingbird up there giggling in the light like a giddy little girl up there the world knows how to love.

            "In Worcester, Massachusetts, I went with Aunt Consuelo to keep her dentists appointment and sat and waited for her in the dentists waiting room. It was winter. It got dark early. The waiting room was full of grown-up people, arctics and overcoats, lamps and magazines. My aunt was inside what seemed like a long time and while I waited I read the National Geographic I could read and carefully studied the photographs the inside of a volcano, black, and full of ashes then it was spilling over in rivulets of fire. Osa and Martin Johnson dressed in riding breeches, laced boots, and pith helmets. A dead man slung on a pole Long Pig, the caption said. Babies with pointed heads wound round and round with string black, naked women with necks wound round and round with wire like the necks of light bulbs. Their breasts were horrifying. I read it right straight through. I was too shy to stop. And then I looked at the cover the yellow margins, the date. Suddenly, from inside, came an oh of pain Aunt Consuelos voice not very loud or long. I wasnt at all surprised even then I knew she was a foolish, timid woman. I might have been embarrassed, but wasnt. What took me completely by surprise was that it was me my voice, in my mouth. Without thinking at all I was my foolish aunt, Iwewere falling, falling, our eyes glued to the cover of the National Geographic, February, 1918. I said to myself three days and youll be seven years old. I was saying it to stop the sensation of falling off the round, turning world. into cold, blue-black space. But I felt you are an I, you are an Elizabeth, you are one of them. Why should you be one, too I scarcely dared to look to see what it was I was. I gave a sidelong glance I couldnt look any higher at shadowy gray knees, trousers and skirts and boots and different pairs of hands lying under the lamps. I knew that nothing stranger had ever happened, that nothing stranger could ever happen. Why should I be my aunt, or me, or anyone What similarities boots, hands, the family voice I felt in my throat, or even the National Geographic and those awful hanging breasts held us all together or made us all just one HowI didnt know any word for ithow unlikely... How had I come to be here, like them, and overhear a cry of pain that could have got loud and worse but hadnt The waiting room was bright and too hot. It was sliding beneath a big black wave, another, and another. Then I was back in it. The War was on. Outside, in Worcester, Massachusetts, were night and slush and cold, and it was still the fifth of February, 1918.\n",

            "All houses wherein men have lived and died Are haunted houses. Through the open doors The harmless phantoms on their errands glide, With feet that make no sound upon the floors. We meet them at the door-way, on the stair, Along the passages they come and go, Impalpable impressions on the air, A sense of something moving to and fro. There are more guests at table than the hosts Invited the illuminated hall Is thronged with quiet, inoffensive ghosts, As silent as the pictures on the wall. The stranger at my fireside cannot see The forms I see, nor hear the sounds I hear He but perceives what is while unto me All that has been is visible and clear. We have no title-deeds to house or lands Owners and occupants of earlier dates From graves forgotten stretch their dusty hands, And hold in mortmain still their old estates. The spirit-world around this world of sense Floats like an atmosphere, and everywhere Wafts through these earthly mists and vapours denseA vital breath of more ethereal air. dense A vital breath of more ethereal air. Our little lives are kept in equipoise By opposite attractions and desires The struggle of the instinct that enjoys, And the more noble instinct that aspires. These perturbations, this perpetual jar Of earthly wants and aspirations high, Come from the influence of an unseen star An undiscovered planet in our sky. And as the moon from some dark gate of cloud Throws oer the sea a floating bridge of light, Across whose trembling planks our fancies crowd Into the realm of mystery and night, So from the world of spirits there descends A bridge of light, connecting it with this, Oer whose unsteady floor, that sways and bends, Wander our thoughts above the dark abyss.\n",

            "Upon that night, when fairies light On Cassilis Downans dance, Or owre the lays, in splendid blaze, On sprightly coursers prance Or for Colean the route is ta'en, Beneath the moon's pale beams There, up the cove, to stray and rove, Among the rocks and streams To sport that night. Among the bonny winding banks, Where Doon rins, wimplin' clear, Where Bruce ance ruled the martial ranks, And shook his Carrick spear, Some merry, friendly, country-folks, Together did convene, To burn their nits, and pou their stocks, And haud their Halloween Fu' blithe that night. The lasses feat, and cleanly neat, Mair braw than when they're fine Their faces blithe, fu' sweetly kythe, Hearts leal, and warm, and kin' The lads sae trig, wi' wooer-babs, Weel knotted on their garten, Some unco blate, and some wi' gabs, Gar lasses' hearts gang startin' Whiles fast at night. Then, first and foremost, through the kail, Their stocks maun a' be sought ance They steek their een, and graip and wale, For muckle anes and straught anes. Poor hav'rel Will fell aff the drift, And wander'd through the bow-kail, And pou't, for want o' better shift, A runt was like a sow-tail, Sae bow't that night. Then, staught or crooked, yird or nane, They roar and cry a' throu'ther The very wee things, todlin', rin, Wi' stocks out owre their shouther And gif the custoc's sweet or sour. Wi' joctelegs they taste them Syne cozily, aboon the door, Wi cannie care, they've placed them To lie that night. The lasses staw frae 'mang them a' To pou their stalks of corn But Rab slips out, and jinks about, Behint the muckle thorn He grippet Nelly hard and fast Loud skirl'd a' the lasses But her tap-pickle maist was lost, When kitlin' in the fause-house Wi' him that night. The auld guidwife's well-hoordit nits, Are round and round divided, And monie lads' and lasses' fates Are there that night decided Some kindle coothie, side by side, And burn thegither trimly Some start awa, wi' saucy pride, And jump out-owre the chimlie Fu' high that night. Jean slips in twa wi' tentie ee Wha 'twas she wadna tell But this is Jock, and this is me, She says in to hersel He bleezed owre her, and she owre him, As they wad never mair part Till, fuff he started up the lum, And Jean had e'en a sair heart To see't that night. Poor Willie, wi' his bow-kail runt, Was brunt wi' primsie Mallie And Mallie, nae doubt, took the drunt, To be compared to Willie Mall's nit lap out wi' pridefu' fling, And her ain fit it brunt it While Willie lap, and swore by jing, 'Twas just the way he wanted To be that night. Nell had the fause-house in her min', She pits hersel and Rob in In loving bleeze they sweetly join, Till white in ase they're sobbin' Nell's heart was dancin' at the view, She whisper'd Rob to leuk for't Rob, stowlins, prie'd her bonny mou', Fu' cozie in the neuk for't, Unseen that night. But Merran sat behint their backs, Her thoughts on Andrew Bell She lea'es them gashin' at their cracks, And slips out by hersel She through the yard the nearest taks, And to the kiln goes then, And darklins graipit for the bauks, And in the blue-clue throws then, Right fear't that night. And aye she win't, and aye she swat, I wat she made nae jaukin', Till something held within the pat, Guid Lord but she was quakin' But whether 'was the deil himsel, Or whether 'twas a bauk-en', Or whether it was Andrew Bell, She didna wait on talkin' To spier that night. Wee Jennie to her grannie says, Will ye go wi' me, grannie I'll eat the apple at the glass I gat frae Uncle Johnnie She fuff't her pipe wi' sic a lunt, In wrath she was sae vap'rin', She notice't na, an aizle brunt Her braw new worset apron Out through that night. Ye little skelpie-limmer's face I daur you try sic sportin', As seek the foul thief ony place, For him to spae your fortune. Nae doubt but ye may get a sight Great cause ye hae to fear it For mony a ane has gotten a fright, And lived and died deleeret On sic a night. Ae hairst afore the Sherramoor, I mind't as weel's yestreen, I was a gilpey then, I'm sure I wasna past fifteen The simmer had been cauld and wat, And stuff was unco green And aye a rantin' kirn we gat, And just on Halloween It fell that night. Our stibble-rig was Rab M'Graen, A clever sturdy fallow His son gat Eppie Sim wi' wean, That lived in Achmacalla He gat hemp-seed, I mind it weel, And he made unco light o't But mony a day was by himsel, He was sae sairly frighted That very night. Then up gat fechtin' Jamie Fleck, And he swore by his conscience, That he could saw hemp-seed a peck For it was a' but nonsense. The auld guidman raught down the pock, And out a hanfu' gied him Syne bade him slip frae 'mang the folk, Some time when nae ane see'd him, And try't that night. He marches through amang the stacks, Though he was something sturtin The graip he for a harrow taks. And haurls it at his curpin And every now and then he says, Hemp-seed, I saw thee, And her that is to be my lass, Come after me, and draw thee As fast this night. He whistled up Lord Lennox' march To keep his courage cheery Although his hair began to arch, He was say fley'd and eerie Till presently he hears a squeak, And then a grane and gruntle He by his shouther gae a keek, And tumbled wi' a wintle Out-owre that night. He roar'd a horrid murder-shout, In dreadfu' desperation And young and auld came runnin' out To hear the sad narration He swore 'twas hilchin Jean M'Craw, Or crouchie Merran Humphie, Till, stop she trotted through them And wha was it but grumphie Asteer that night Meg fain wad to the barn hae gaen, To win three wechts o' naething But for to meet the deil her lane, She pat but little faith in She gies the herd a pickle nits, And two red-cheekit apples, To watch, while for the barn she sets, In hopes to see Tam Kipples That very nicht. She turns the key wi cannie thraw, And owre the threshold ventures But first on Sawnie gies a ca' Syne bauldly in she enters A ratton rattled up the wa', And she cried, Lord, preserve her And ran through midden-hole and a', And pray'd wi' zeal and fervour, Fu' fast that night They hoy't out Will wi' sair advice They hecht him some fine braw ane It chanced the stack he faddom'd thrice Was timmer-propt for thrawin' He taks a swirlie, auld moss-oak, For some black grousome carlin And loot a winze, and drew a stroke, Till skin in blypes cam haurlin' Aff's nieves that night. A wanton widow Leezie was, As canty as a kittlin But, och that night amang the shaws, She got a fearfu' settlin' She through the whins, and by the cairn, And owre the hill gaed scrievin, Whare three lairds' lands met at a burn To dip her left sark-sleeve in, Was bent that night. Whyles owre a linn the burnie plays, As through the glen it wimpl't Whyles round a rocky scaur it strays Whyles in a wiel it dimpl't Whyles glitter'd to the nightly rays, Wi' bickering, dancing dazzle Whyles cookit underneath the braes, Below the spreading hazel, Unseen that night. Among the brackens, on the brae, Between her and the moon, The deil, or else an outler quey, Gat up and gae a croon Poor Leezie's heart maist lap the hool Near lav'rock-height she jumpit but mist a fit, and in the pool Out-owre the lugs she plumpit, Wi' a plunge that night. In order, on the clean hearth-stane, The luggies three are ranged, And every time great care is ta'en', To see them duly changed Auld Uncle John, wha wedlock joys Sin' Mar's year did desire, Because he gat the toom dish thrice, He heaved them on the fire In wrath that night. Wi' merry sangs, and friendly cracks, I wat they didna weary And unco tales, and funny jokes, Their sports were cheap and cheery Till butter'd so'ns, wi' fragrant lunt, Set a' their gabs a-steerin' Syne, wi' a social glass o' strunt, They parted aff careerin' Fu' blythe that night.\n",

Today, a dozen squid, dead on the harbor beach one mostly buried, one with skin empty as a shell and hollow feeling, and, though the tentacles look soft, I do not touch them. I imagine they were startled to find themselves in the sun. I imagine the tide simply went out without them. I imagine they cannot feel the black flies charting the raised hills of their eyes. I write my name in the sand Donika Kelly. I watch eighteen seagulls skim the sandbar and lift low in the sky. I pick up a pebble that looks like a green egg. To the ditch lily I say I am in love. To the Jeep parked haphazardly on the narrow street I am in love. To the roses, white petals rimmed brown, to the yellow lined pavement, to the house trimmed in gold I am in love. I shout with the rough calculus of walking. Just let me find my way back, let me move like a tide come in.\n",

Middle Passage voyage through death to life upon these shores. 10 April 1800 Blacks rebellious. Crew uneasy. Our linguist says their moaning is a prayer for death, ours and their own. Some try to starve themselves. Lost three this morning leaped with crazy laughter to the waiting sharks, sang as they went under.

I cannot sleep, for I am sick with fear, but writing eases fear a little since still my eyes can see these words take shape upon the page so I write, as one would turn to exorcism. 4 days scudding, but now the sea is calm again. Misfortune follows in our wake like sharks our grinning tutelary gods. Which one of us has killed an albatross A plague among our blacksOphthalmia blindness we have jettisoned the blind to no avail. It spreads, the terrifying sickness spreads. Its claws have scratched sight from the Capt.'s eyes there is blindness in the focsle we must sail 3 weeks before we come to port. What port awaits us, Davy Jones or home Ive heard of slavers drifting, drifting, playthings of wind and storm and chance, their crews gone blind, the jungle hatred crawling up on deck. Thou Who Walked On Galilee Deponent further sayeth The Bella J left the Guinea Coast with cargo of five hundred blacks and odd for the barracoons of Florida That there was hardly room tween-decks for half the sweltering cattle stowed spoon-fashion there that some went mad of thirst and tore their flesh and sucked the blood That Crew and Captain lusted with the comeliest of the savage girls kept naked in the cabins that there was one they called The Guinea Rose and they cast lots and fought to lie with her That when the Bosn piped all hands, the flames spreading from starboard already were beyond control, the negroes howling and their chains entangled with the flames That the burning blacks could not be reached, that the Crew abandoned ship, leaving their shrieking negresses behind, that the Captain perished drunken with the wenches Further Deponent sayeth not. Pilot Oh Pilot Me II Aye, lad, and I have seen those factories, Gambia, Rio Pongo, Calabar have watched the artful mongos baiting traps of war wherein the victor and the vanquished Were caught as prizes for our barracoons.

And there was oneKing Anthracite we named him fetish face beneath French parasols of brass and orange velvet, impudent mouth whose cups were carven skulls of enemies Hed honor us with drum and feast and conjo and palm-oil-glistening wenches deft in love, and for tin crowns that shone with paste, red calico and German-silver trinkets Would have the drums talk war and send his warriors to burn the sleeping villages and kill the sick and old and lead the young in coffles to our factories. Twenty years a trader, twenty years, for there was wealth aplenty to be harvested from those black fields, and Id be trading still but for the fevers melting down my bones. III Shuttles in the rocking loom of history, the dark ships move, the dark ships move, their bright ironical names like jests of kindness on a murderers mouth plough through thrashing glister toward fata morganas lucent melting shore, weave toward New World littorals that are mirage and myth and actual shore. Voyage through death, voyage whose chartings are unlove. A charnel stench, effluvium of living death spreads outward from the hold, where the living and the dead, the horribly dying, lie interlocked, lie foul with blood and excrement. Deep in the festering hold thy father lies, the corpse of mercy rots with him, rats eat loves rotten gelid eyes. But, oh, the living look at you with human eyes whose suffering accuses you, whose hatred reaches through the swill of dark to strike you like a lepers claw. You cannot stare that hatred down or chain the fear that stalks the watches and breathes on you its fetid scorching breath cannot kill the deep immortal human wish, the timeless will. But for the storm that flung up barriers of wind and wave, The Amistad, señores, would have reached the port of Príncipe in two, three days at most but for the storm we should have been prepared for what befell. Swift as the pumas leap it came. There was that interval of moonless calm filled only with the waters and the riggings usual sounds, then sudden movement, blows and snarling cries and they had fallen on us with machete and marlinspike. It was as though the very air, the night itself were striking us. Exhausted by the rigors of the storm, we were no match for them. Our men went down before the murderous Africans. Our loyal Celestino ran from below with gun and lantern and I saw, before the cane- knifes wounding flash, Cinquez, that surly brute who calls himself a prince, directing, urging on the ghastly work. He hacked the poor mulatto down, and then he turned on me. The decks were slippery when daylight finally came. It sickens me to think of what I saw, of how these apes threw overboard the butchered bodies of our men, true Christians all, like so much jetsam. Enough, enough. The rest is quickly told Cinquez was forced to spare the two of us you see to steer the ship to Africa, and we like phantoms doomed to rove the sea voyaged east by day and west by night, deceiving them, hoping for rescue, prisoners on our own vessel, till at length we drifted to the shores of this your land, America, where we were freed from our unspeakable misery. Now we demand, good sirs, the extradition of Cinquez and his accomplices to La Havana. And it distresses us to know there are so many here who seem inclined to justify the mutiny of these blacks. We find it paradoxical indeed that you whose wealth, whose tree of liberty are rooted in the labor of your slaves should suffer the august John Quincy Adams to speak with so much passion of the right of chattel slaves to kill their lawful masters and with his Roman rhetoric weave a heros garland for Cinquez. I tell you that we are determined to return to Cuba with our slaves and there see justice done. Cinquez or let us say the PrinceCinquez shall die. The deep immortal human wish, the timeless will Cinquez its deathless primaveral image, life that transfigures many lives. Voyage through death to life upon these shores.\n",

            "One Sister have I in our house - And one a hedge away. There's only one recorded, But both belong to me. One came the way that I came - And wore my past year's gown - The other as a bird her nest, Builded our hearts among. She did not sing as we did - It was a different tune - Herself to her a Music As Bumble-bee of June. Today is far from Childhood - But up and down the hills I held her hand the tighter - Which shortened all the miles - And still her hum The years among, Deceives the Butterfly Still in her Eye The Violets lie Mouldered this many May. I spilt the dew - But took the morn, - I chose this single star From out the wide night's numbers - Sue - forevermore\n",

            "Over the river, and through the wood, To grandfather's house we go The horse knows the way To carry the sleigh Through the white and drifted snow. Over the river, and through the wood Oh, how the wind does blow It stings the toes And bites the nose As over the ground we go. Over the river, and through the wood, To have a first-rate play. Hear the bells ring Ting-a-ling-ding, Hurrah for Thanksgiving Day Over the river, and through the wood Trot fast, my dapple-gray Spring over the ground, Like a hunting-hound For this is Thanksgiving Day. Over the river, and through the wood, And straight through the barn-yard gate. We seem to go Extremely slow, It is so hard to wait Over the river and through the wood Now grandmother's cap I spy Hurrah for the fun Is the pudding done Hurrah for the pumpkin-pie\n",

            "We walk on starry fields of white And do not see the daisiesFor blessings common in our sight We rarely offer praises.We sigh for some supreme delight To crown our lives with splendor,And quite ignore our daily store Of pleasures sweet and tender. Our cares are bold and push their way Upon our thought and feeling.They hand about us all the day, Our time from pleasure stealing.So unobtrusive many a joy We pass by and forget it,But worry strives to own our lives, And conquers if we let it. Theres not a day in all the year But holds some hidden pleasure,And looking back, joys oft appear To brim the pasts wide measure.But blessings are like friends, I hold, Who love and labor near us.We ought to raise our notes of praise While living hearts can hear us. Full many a blessing wears the guise Of worry or of troubleFar-seeing is the soul, and wise, Who knows the mask is double.But he who has the faith and strength To thank his God for sorrowHas found a joy without alloy To gladden every morrow. We ought to make the moments notes Of happy, glad ThanksgivingThe hours and days a silent phrase Of music we are living.And so the theme should swell and grow As weeks and months pass oer us,And rise sublime at this good time, A grand Thanksgiving chorus. This poem is in the public domain.\n",

            "In the beginning there was the war. The war said let there be war and there was war. The war said let there be peace and there was war. The people said music and rain evaporating against fire in the brush was a kind of music and so was the beast. The beast that roared or bleated when brought down was silent when skinned but loud after the skin was pulled taut over wood and the people said music and the thump thump thump said drum. Someone said war drum. The drum said war is coming to meet you in the field. The field said war tastes like copper, said give us some more, said look at the wild flowers our war plants in a grove and grows just for us. Outside sheets are pulling this way and that. Fields are smoke, smoke is air. We wait for fingers to be bent knuckle to knuckle, the porch overrun with rope and shotgun but the hounds dont show. We beat the drum and sing like theres nothing outside but rust-colored clay and fields of wild flowers growing farther than we can walk. Torches may come like fox paws to steal away what we plant, but with our bodies bound by the skin, my arc to his curve, we are stalks that will bend and bend and bend fire for heat fire for light fire for casting figures on a dungeon wall fire for teaching shadows to writhe fire for keeping beasts at bay fire to give them back to the earth fire for the siege fire to singe fire to roast fire to fuse rubber soles to collapsed crossbeams fire for Gehenna fire for Dante fire for Fallujah fire for readied aim fire in the forge that folds steel like a flag fire to curl worms like cigarette ash fire to give them back to the earth fire for ancient reasons to call down rain fire to catch it and turn it into steam fire for churches fire for a stockpile of books fire for a bible-black cloak tied to a stake fire for smoke signals fire to shape gun muzzle and magazine fire to leap from the gut of a furnace fire for Hephaestus fire for pyres sake fire licking the toes of a quiet brown man fire for his home fire for her flag fire for this sand, to coax it into glass fire to cure mirrors fire to cure leeches Fire to compose a nocturne of cinders fire for the trash cans illuminating streets fire for fuel fire for fields fire for the field hands fourth death fire to make a cross visible for several yards fire from the dragons mouth fire for smoking out tangos fire to stoke like rage and fill the sky with human remains fire to give them back to the earth fire to make twine fall from bound wrists fire to mark them all and bubble black any flesh it touches as it frees They took the light from our eyes. Possessive. Took the moisture from our throats. My arms, my lips, my sternum, sucked dry, and lovers of autumn say, Look, here is beauty. Tallness only made me an obvious target made of off-kilter limbs. Id fall either way. I should get a to-the-death tattoo or metal ribbon of some sort. War took our prayers like nothing else can, left us dumber than remote drones. Make me a loyal soldier and Ill make you a lamenting so thick, metallic, so tank-tread-hard. Now make tomorrow a gate shaped like a man. I cant promise, when its time, I wont hesitate, cannot say I wont forget to return in fall and guess the names of the leaves before they change. The war said bring us your dead and we died. The people said music and bending flower, so we sang ballads in the aisles of churches and fruit markets. The requiem was everywhere a comets tail disappearing into the atmosphere, the wide mouths of the bereft men that have sung On currents of air, seeds were carried as the processional carried us through the streets of a forgetting city, between the cold iron of gates. The field said soil is rich wherever we fall. Arent graveyards and battlefields our most efficient gardens Journeys begin there too if the flowers are taken into account, and shouldnt we always take the flowers into account Bring them to us. Well come back to you. Peace will come to you as a rosewood-colored road paver in your grandmothers town, as a trench scraped into canvas, as a violin bow, a shovel, an easel, a brushstroke that covers burial mounds in grass. And love, you say, is a constant blade, a trowel that plants and uproots, and tomorrow will be a tornado, you say. Then war, a sick wind, will come to part the air, straighten your suit, and place fresh flowers on all our muddy graves.\n",

Away to the window I flew like a flash, Tore open the shutters and threw up the sash. The moon on the breast of the new-fallen snow Gave the lustre of mid-day to objects below, When, what to my wondering eyes should appear, But a miniature sleigh, and eight tiny reindeer, With a little old driver, so lively and quick, I knew in a moment it must be St. Nick. More rapid than eagles his coursers they came, And he whistled, and shouted, and called them by name Now, Dasher now, Dancer now, Prancer and Vixen On, Comet on, Cupid on, Donder and Blitzen To the top of the porch to the top of the wall Now dash away dash away dash away all As dry leaves that before the wild hurricane fly, When they meet with an obstacle, mount to the sky So up to the house-top the coursers they flew, With the sleigh full of Toys, and St. Nicholas too. And then, in a twinkling, I heard on the roof The prancing and pawing of each little hoof. As I drew in my head, and was turning around, Down the chimney St. Nicholas came with a bound. He was dressed all in fur, from his head to his foot, And his clothes were all tarnished with ashes and soot A bundle of Toys he had flung on his back, And he looked like a pedler just opening his pack. His eyeshow they twinkled his dimples how merry His cheeks were like roses, his nose like a cherry His droll little mouth was drawn up like a bow And the beard of his chin was as white as the snow The stump of a pipe he held tight in his teeth, And the smoke it encircled his head like a wreath He had a broad face and a little round belly, That shook when he laughed, like a bowlful of jelly. He was chubby and plump, a right jolly old elf, And I laughed when I saw him, in spite of myself A wink of his eye and a twist of his head, Soon gave me to know I had nothing to dread He spoke not a word, but went straight to his work, And filled all the stockings then turned with a jerk, And laying his finger aside of his nose, And giving a nod, up the chimney he rose He sprang to his sleigh, to his team gave a whistle, And away they all flew like the down of a thistle, But I heard him exclaim, ere he drove out of sight, Happy Christmas to all, and to all a good-night.\n",

There are some millionaires With money they cant use Their wives run round like banshees Their children sing the blues Theyve got expensive doctors To cure their hearts of stone. But nobody No, nobody Can make it out here alone. Alone, all alone Nobody, but nobody Can make it out here alone. Now if you listen closely Ill tell you what I know Storm clouds are gathering The wind is gonna blow The race of man is suffering And I can hear the moan, Cause nobody, But nobody Can make it out here alone. Alone, all alone Nobody, but nobody Can make it out here alone.\n",

            "Ah broken is the golden bowl the spirit flown forever Let the bell toll--a saintly soul floats on the Stygian river And, Guy De Vere, hast thou no tear--weep now or never more See on yon drear and rigid bier low lies thy love, Lenore Come let the burial rite be read--the funeral song be sung-- An anthem for the queenliest dead that ever died so young-- A dirge for her the doubly dead in that she died so young. Wretches ye loved her for her wealth and hated her for her pride, And when she fell in feeble health, ye blessed her--that she died How shall the ritual, then, be read--the requiem how be sung By you--by yours, the evil eye,--by yours, the slanderous tongue That did to death the innocent that died, and died so young Peccavimus but rave not thus and let a Sabbath song Go up to God so solemnly the dead may feel so wrong The sweet Lenore hath gone before, with Hope, that flew beside Leaving thee wild for the dear child that should have been thy bride-- For her, the fair and debonair, that now so lowly lies, The life upon her yellow hair but not within her eyes-- The life still there, upon her hair--the death upon her eyes. Avaunt to-night my heart is light. No dirge will I upraise, But waft the angel on her flight with a Pæan of old days Let no bell toll--lest her sweet soul, amid its hallowed mirth, Should catch the note, as it doth float up from the damnéd Earth. To friends above, from fiends below, the indignant ghost is riven-- From Hell unto a high estate far up within the Heaven-- From grief and groan, to a golden throne, beside the King of Heaven.\n",

            "Season of mists and mellow fruitfulness, Close bosom-friend of the maturing sun Conspiring with him how to load and bless With fruit the vines that round the thatch-eves run To bend with apples the mossd cottage-trees, And fill all fruit with ripeness to the core To swell the gourd, and plump the hazel shells With a sweet kernel to set budding more, And still more, later flowers for the bees, Until they think warm days will never cease, For summer has oer-brimmd their clammy cells. Who hath not seen thee oft amid thy store Sometimes whoever seeks abroad may find Thee sitting careless on a granary floor, Thy hair soft-lifted by the winnowing wind Or on a half-reapd furrow sound asleep, Drowsed with the fume of poppies, while thy hook Spares the next swath and all its twined flowers And sometimes like a gleaner thou dost keep Steady thy laden head across a brook Or by a cider-press, with patient look, Thou watchest the last oozings, hours by hours. Where are the songs of Spring Ay, where are they Think not of them, thou hast thy music too, While barred clouds bloom the soft-dying day, And touch the stubble-plains with rosy hue Then in a wailful choir the small gnats mourn Among the river sallows, borne aloft Or sinking as the light wind lives or dies And full-grown lambs loud bleat from hilly bourn Hedge-crickets sing and now with treble soft The redbreast whistles from a garden-croft, And gathering swallows twitter in the skies.\n",

            "Then Almitra spoke, saying, We would ask now of Death. And he said You would know the secret of death. But how shall you find it unless you seek it in the heart of life The owl whose night-bound eyes are blind unto the day cannot unveil the mystery of light. If you would indeed behold the spirit of death, open your heart wide unto the body of life. For life and death are one, even as the river and the sea are one. In the depth of your hopes and desires lies your silent knowledge of the beyond And like seeds dreaming beneath the snow your heart dreams of spring. Trust the dreams, for in them is hidden the gate to eternity. Your fear of death is but the trembling of the shepherd when he stands before the king whose hand is to be laid upon him in honour. Is the shepherd not joyful beneath his trembling, that he shall wear the mark of the king Yet is he not more mindful of his trembling For what is it to die but to stand naked in the wind and to melt into the sun And what is it to cease breathing, but to free the breath from its restless tides, that it may rise and expand and seek God unencumbered Only when you drink from the river of silence shall you indeed sing. And when you have reached the mountain top, then you shall begin to climb. And when the earth shall claim your limbs, then shall you truly dance.\n",

            "Once more the storm is howling, and half hid Under this cradle-hood and coverlid My child sleeps on. There is no obstacle But Gregory's wood and one bare hill Whereby the haystack- and roof-levelling wind, Bred on the Atlantic, can be stayed And for an hour I have walked and prayed Because of the great gloom that is in my mind. I have walked and prayed for this young child an hour And heard the sea-wind scream upon the tower, And under the arches of the bridge, and scream In the elms above the flooded stream Imagining in excited reverie That the future years had come, Dancing to a frenzied drum, Out of the murderous innocence of the sea. May she be granted beauty and yet not Beauty to make a stranger's eye distraught, Or hers before a looking-glass, for such, Being made beautiful overmuch, Consider beauty a sufficient end, Lose natural kindness and maybe The heart-revealing intimacy That chooses right, and never find a friend. Helen being chosen found life flat and dull And later had much trouble from a fool, While that great Queen, that rose out of the spray, Being fatherless could have her way Yet chose a bandy-leggèd smith for man. It's certain that fine women eat A crazy salad with their meat Whereby the Horn of Plenty is undone. In courtesy I'd have her chiefly learned Hearts are not had as a gift but hearts are earned By those that are not entirely beautiful Yet many, that have played the fool For beauty's very self, has charm made wise, And many a poor man that has roved, Loved and thought himself beloved, From a glad kindness cannot take his eyes. May she become a flourishing hidden tree That all her thoughts may like the linnet be, And have no business but dispensing round Their magnanimities of sound, Nor but in merriment begin a chase, Nor but in merriment a quarrel. O may she live like some green laurel Rooted in one dear perpetual place. My mind, because the minds that I have loved, The sort of beauty that I have approved, Prosper but little, has dried up of late, Yet knows that to be choked with hate May well be of all evil chances chief. If there's no hatred in a mind Assault and battery of the wind Can never tear the linnet from the leaf. An intellectual hatred is the worst, So let her think opinions are accursed. Have I not seen the loveliest woman born Out of the mouth of Plenty's horn, Because of her opinionated mind Barter that horn and every good By quiet natures understood For an old bellows full of angry wind Considering that, all hatred driven hence, The soul recovers radical innocence And learns at last that it is self-delighting, Self-appeasing, self-affrighting, And that its own sweet will is Heaven's will She can, though every face should scowl And every windy quarter howl Or every bellows burst, be happy still. And may her bridegroom bring her to a house Where all's accustomed, ceremonious For arrogance and hatred are the wares Peddled in the thoroughfares. How but in custom and in ceremony Are innocence and beauty born Ceremony's a name for the rich horn, And custom for the spreading laurel tree.\n",

You shall be together when the white wings of death scatter your days. Ay, you shall be together even in the silent memory of God. But let there be spaces in your togetherness, And let the winds of the heavens dance between you. Love one another, but make not a bond of love Let it rather be a moving sea between the shores of your souls. Fill each others cup but drink not from one cup. Give one another of your bread but eat not from the same loaf. Sing and dance together and be joyous, but let each one of your be alone, Even as the strings of the lute are alone though they quiver with the same music. Give your hearts, but not into each others keeping. For only the hand of Life can contain your hearts. And stand together yet not too near together For the pillars of the temple stand apart, And the oak tree and the cypress grow not in each others shadow. From The Prophet Knopf, 1923.

            "I He did not wear his scarlet coat, For blood and wine are red, And blood and wine were on his hands When they found him with the dead, The poor dead woman whom he loved, And murdered in her bed. He walked amongst the Trial Men In a suit of shabby grey A cricket cap was on his head, And his step seemed light and gay But I never saw a man who looked So wistfully at the day. I never saw a man who looked With such a wistful eye Upon that little tent of blue Which prisoners call the sky, And at every drifting cloud that went With sails of silver by. I walked, with other souls in pain, Within another ring, And was wondering if the man had done A great or little thing, When a voice behind me whispered low, That fellow's got to swing. Dear Christ the very prison walls Suddenly seemed to reel, And the sky above my head became Like a casque of scorching steel And, though I was a soul in pain, My pain I could not feel. I only knew what hunted thought Quickened his step, and why He looked upon the garish day With such a wistful eye The man had killed the thing he loved And so he had to die. Yet each man kills the thing he loves By each let this be heard, Some do it with a bitter look, Some with a flattering word, The coward does it with a kiss, The brave man with a sword Some kill their love when they are young, And some when they are old Some strangle with the hands of Lust, Some with the hands of Gold The kindest use a knife, because The dead so soon grow cold. Some love too little, some too long, Some sell, and others buy Some do the deed with many tears, And some without a sigh For each man kills the thing he loves, Yet each man does not die. He does not die a death of shame On a day of dark disgrace, Nor have a noose about his neck, Nor a cloth upon his face, Nor drop feet foremost through the floor Into an empty place He does not sit with silent men Who watch him night and day Who watch him when he tries to weep, And when he tries to pray Who watch him lest himself should rob The prison of its prey. He does not wake at dawn to see Dread figures throng his room, The shivering Chaplain robed in white, The Sheriff stern with gloom, And the Governor all in shiny black, With the yellow face of Doom. He does not rise in piteous haste To put on convict-clothes, While some coarse-mouthed Doctor gloats, and notes Each new and nerve-twitched pose, Fingering a watch whose little ticks Are like horrible hammer-blows. He does not know that sickening thirst That sands one's throat, before The hangman with his gardener's gloves Slips through the padded door, And binds one with three leathern thongs, That the throat may thirst no more. He does not bend his head to hear The Burial Office read, Nor, while the terror of his soul Tells him he is not dead, Cross his own coffin, as he moves Into the hideous shed. He does not stare upon the air Through a little roof of glass He does not pray with lips of clay For his agony to pass Nor feel upon his shuddering cheek The kiss of Caiaphas. II Six weeks our guardsman walked the yard, In a suit of shabby grey His cricket cap was on his head, And his step seemed light and gay, But I never saw a man who looked So wistfully at the day. I never saw a man who looked With such a wistful eye Upon that little tent of blue Which prisoners call the sky, And at every wandering cloud that trailed Its raveled fleeces by. He did not wring his hands, as do Those witless men who dare To try to rear the changeling Hope In the cave of black Despair He only looked upon the sun, And drank the morning air. He did not wring his hands nor weep, Nor did he peek or pine, But he drank the air as though it held Some healthful anodyne With open mouth he drank the sun As though it had been wine And I and all the souls in pain, Who tramped the other ring, Forgot if we ourselves had done A great or little thing, And watched with gaze of dull amaze The man who had to swing. And strange it was to see him pass With a step so light and gay, And strange it was to see him look So wistfully at the day, And strange it was to think that he Had such a debt to pay. For oak and elm have pleasant leaves That in the spring-time shoot But grim to see is the gallows-tree, With its adder-bitten root, And, green or dry, a man must die Before it bears its fruit The loftiest place is that seat of grace For which all worldlings try But who would stand in hempen band Upon a scaffold high, And through a murderer's collar take His last look at the sky It is sweet to dance to violins When Love and Life are fair To dance to flutes, to dance to lutes Is delicate and rare But it is not sweet with nimble feet To dance upon the air So with curious eyes and sick surmise We watched him day by day, And wondered if each one of us Would end the self-same way, For none can tell to what red Hell His sightless soul may stray. At last the dead man walked no more Amongst the Trial Men, And I knew that he was standing up In the black dock's dreadful pen, And that never would I see his face In God's sweet world again. Like two doomed ships that pass in storm We had crossed each other's way But we made no sign, we said no word, We had no word to say For we did not meet in the holy night, But in the shameful day. A prison wall was round us both, Two outcast men were we The world had thrust us from its heart, And God from out His care And the iron gin that waits for Sin Had caught us in its snare. III In Debtors' Yard the stones are hard, And the dripping wall is high, So it was there he took the air Beneath the leaden sky, And by each side a Warder walked, For fear the man might die. Or else he sat with those who watched His anguish night and day Who watched him when he rose to weep, And when he crouched to pray Who watched him lest himself should rob Their scaffold of its prey. The Governor was strong upon The Regulations Act The Doctor said that Death was but A scientific fact And twice a day the Chaplain called And left a little tract. And twice a day he smoked his pipe, And drank his quart of beer His soul was resolute, and held No hiding-place for fear He often said that he was glad The hangman's hands were near. But why he said so strange a thing No Warder dared to ask For he to whom a watcher's doom Is given as his task, Must set a lock upon his lips, And make his face a mask. Or else he might be moved, and try To comfort or console And what should Human Pity do Pent up in Murderers' Hole What word of grace in such a place Could help a brother's soul With slouch and swing around the ring We trod the Fool's Parade We did not care we knew we were The Devil's Own Brigade And shaven head and feet of lead Make a merry masquerade. We tore the tarry rope to shreds With blunt and bleeding nails We rubbed the doors, and scrubbed the floors, And cleaned the shining rails And, rank by rank, we soaped the plank, And clattered with the pails. We sewed the sacks, we broke the stones, We turned the dusty drill We banged the tins, and bawled the hymns, And sweated on the mill But in the heart of every man Terror was lying still. So still it lay that every day Crawled like a weed-clogged wave And we forgot the bitter lot That waits for fool and knave Till once, as we tramped in from work, We passed an open grave. With yawning mouth the yellow hole Gaped for a living thing The very mud cried out for blood To the thirsty asphalte ring And we knew that ere one dawn grew fair Some prisoner had to swing. Right in we went, with soul intent On Death and Dread and Doom The hangman, with his little bag, Went shuffling through the gloom And each man trembled as he crept Into his numbered tomb. That night the empty corridors Were full of forms of Fear, And up and down the iron town Stole feet we could not hear, And through the bars that hide the stars White faces seemed to peer. He lay as one who lies and dreams In a pleasant meadow-land, The watcher watched him as he slept, And could not understand How one could sleep so sweet a sleep With a hangman close at hand But there is no sleep when men must weep Who never yet have wept So wethe fool, the fraud, the knave That endless vigil kept, And through each brain on hands of pain Another's terror crept. Alas it is a fearful thing To feel another's guilt For, right within, the sword of Sin Pierced to its poisoned hilt, And as molten lead were the tears we shed For the blood we had not spilt. The Warders with their shoes of felt Crept by each padlocked door, And peeped and saw, with eyes of awe, Grey figures on the floor, And wondered why men knelt to pray Who never prayed before. All through the night we knelt and prayed, Mad mourners of a corpse The troubled plumes of midnight were The plumes upon a hearse And bitter wine upon a sponge Was the savior of Remorse. The cock crew, the red cock crew, But never came the day And crooked shape of Terror crouched, In the corners where we lay And each evil sprite that walks by night Before us seemed to play. They glided past, they glided fast, Like travelers through a mist They mocked the moon in a rigadoon Of delicate turn and twist, And with formal pace and loathsome grace The phantoms kept their tryst. With mop and mow, we saw them go, Slim shadows hand in hand About, about, in ghostly rout They trod a saraband And the damned grotesques made arabesques, Like the wind upon the sand With the pirouettes of marionettes, They tripped on pointed tread But with flutes of Fear they filled the ear, As their grisly masque they led, And loud they sang, and loud they sang, For they sang to wake the dead. Oho they cried, The world is wide, But fettered limbs go lame And once, or twice, to throw the dice Is a gentlemanly game, But he does not win who plays with Sin In the secret House of Shame. No things of air these antics were That frolicked with such glee To men whose lives were held in gyves, And whose feet might not go free, Ah wounds of Christ they were living things, Most terrible to see. Around, around, they waltzed and wound Some wheeled in smirking pairs With the mincing step of demirep Some sidled up the stairs And with subtle sneer, and fawning leer, Each helped us at our prayers. The morning wind began to moan, But still the night went on Through its giant loom the web of gloom Crept till each thread was spun And, as we prayed, we grew afraid Of the Justice of the Sun. The moaning wind went wandering round The weeping prison-wall Till like a wheel of turning-steel We felt the minutes crawl O moaning wind what had we done To have such a seneschal At last I saw the shadowed bars Like a lattice wrought in lead, Move right across the whitewashed wall That faced my three-plank bed, And I knew that somewhere in the world God's dreadful dawn was red. At six o'clock we cleaned our cells, At seven all was still, But the sough and swing of a mighty wing The prison seemed to fill, For the Lord of Death with icy breath Had entered in to kill. He did not pass in purple pomp, Nor ride a moon-white steed. Three yards of cord and a sliding board Are all the gallows' need So with rope of shame the Herald came To do the secret deed. We were as men who through a fen Of filthy darkness grope We did not dare to breathe a prayer, Or give our anguish scope Something was dead in each of us, And what was dead was Hope. For Man's grim Justice goes its way, And will not swerve aside It slays the weak, it slays the strong, It has a deadly stride With iron heel it slays the strong, The monstrous parricide We waited for the stroke of eight Each tongue was thick with thirst For the stroke of eight is the stroke of Fate That makes a man accursed, And Fate will use a running noose For the best man and the worst. We had no other thing to do, Save to wait for the sign to com So, like things of stone in a valley lone, Quiet we sat and dumb But each man's heart beat thick and quick Like a madman on a drum With sudden shock the prison-clock Smote on the shivering air, And from all the gaol rose up a wail Of impotent despair, Like the sound that frightened marshes hear From a leper in his lair. And as one sees most fearful things In the crystal of a dream, We saw the greasy hempen rope Hooked to the blackened beam, And heard the prayer the hangman's snare Strangled into a scream. And all the woe that moved him so That he gave that bitter cry, And the wild regrets, and the bloody sweats, None knew so well as I For he who lives more lives than one More deaths than one must die. IV There is no chapel on the day On which they hang a man The Chaplain's heart is far too sick, Or his face is far too wan, Or there is that written in his eyes Which none should look upon. So they kept us close till nigh on noon, And then they rang the bell, And the Warders with their jingling keys Opened each listening cell, And down the iron stair we tramped, Each from his separate Hell. Out into God's sweet air we went, But not in wonted way, For this man's face was white with fear, And that man's face was grey, And I never saw sad men who looked So wistfully at the day. I never saw sad men who looked With such a wistful eye Upon that little tent of blue We prisoners called the sky, And at every careless cloud that passed In happy freedom by. But there were those amongst us all Who walked with downcast head, And knew that, had each got his due, They should have died instead He had but killed a thing that lived Whilst they had killed the dead. For he who sins a second time Wakes a dead soul to pain, And draws it from its spotted shroud, And makes it bleed again, And makes it bleed great gouts of blood And makes it bleed in vain Like ape or clown, in monstrous garb With crooked arrows starred, Silently we went round and round The slippery asphalte yard Silently we went round and round, And no man spoke a word. Silently we went round and round, And through each hollow mind The memory of dreadful things Rushed like a dreadful wind, And Horror stalked before each man, And terror crept behind. The Warders strutted up and down, And kept their herd of brutes, Their uniforms were spick and span, And they wore their Sunday suits, But we knew the work they had been at By the quicklime on their boots. For where a grave had opened wide, There was no grave at all Only a stretch of mud and sand By the hideous prison-wall, And a little heap of burning lime, That the man should have his pall. For he has a pall, this wretched man, Such as few men can claim Deep down below a prison-yard, Naked for greater shame, He lies, with fetters on each foot, Wrapt in a sheet of flame And all the while the burning lime Eats flesh and bone away, It eats the brittle bone by night, And the soft flesh by the day, It eats the flesh and bones by turns, But it eats the heart alway. For three long years they will not sow Or root or seedling there For three long years the unblessed spot Will sterile be and bare, And look upon the wondering sky With unreproachful stare. They think a murderer's heart would taint Each simple seed they sow. It is not true God's kindly earth Is kindlier than men know, And the red rose would but blow more red, The white rose whiter blow. Out of his mouth a red, red rose Out of his heart a white For who can say by what strange way, Christ brings his will to light, Since the barren staff the pilgrim bore Bloomed in the great Pope's sight But neither milk-white rose nor red May bloom in prison air The shard, the pebble, and the flint, Are what they give us there For flowers have been known to heal A common man's despair. So never will wine-red rose or white, Petal by petal, fall On that stretch of mud and sand that lies By the hideous prison-wall, To tell the men who tramp the yard 7nbsp That God's Son died for all. Yet though the hideous prison-wall Still hems him round and round, And a spirit man not walk by night That is with fetters bound, And a spirit may not weep that lies In such unholy ground, He is at peacethis wretched man At peace, or will be soon There is no thing to make him mad, Nor does Terror walk at noon, For the lampless Earth in which he lies Has neither Sun nor Moon. They hanged him as a beast is hanged They did not even toll A reguiem that might have brought Rest to his startled soul, But hurriedly they took him out, And hid him in a hole. They stripped him of his canvas clothes, And gave him to the flies They mocked the swollen purple throat And the stark and staring eyes And with laughter loud they heaped the shroud In which their convict lies. The Chaplain would not kneel to pray By his dishonored grave Nor mark it with that blessed Cross That Christ for sinners gave, Because the man was one of those Whom Christ came down to save. Yet all is well he has but passed To Life's appointed bourne And alien tears will fill for him Pity's long-broken urn, For his mourner will be outcast men, And outcasts always mourn. V I know not whether Laws be right, Or whether Laws be wrong All that we know who lie in gaol Is that the wall is strong And that each day is like a year, A year whose days are long. But this I know, that every Law That men have made for Man, Since first Man took his brother's life, And the sad world began, But straws the wheat and saves the chaff With a most evil fan. This too I knowand wise it were If each could know the same That every prison that men build Is built with bricks of shame, And bound with bars lest Christ should see How men their brothers maim. With bars they blur the gracious moon, And blind the goodly sun And they do well to hide their Hell, For in it things are done That Son of God nor son of Man Ever should look upon The vilest deeds like poison weeds Bloom well in prison-air It is only what is good in Man That wastes and withers there Pale Anguish keeps the heavy gate, And the Warder is Despair For they starve the little frightened child Till it weeps both night and day And they scourge the weak, and flog the fool, And gibe the old and grey, And some grow mad, and all grow bad, And none a word may say. Each narrow cell in which we dwell Is foul and dark latrine, And the fetid breath of living Death Chokes up each grated screen, And all, but Lust, is turned to dust In Humanity's machine. The brackish water that we drink Creeps with a loathsome slime, And the bitter bread they weigh in scales Is full of chalk and lime, And Sleep will not lie down, but walks Wild-eyed and cries to Time. But though lean Hunger and green Thirst Like asp with adder fight, We have little care of prison fare, For what chills and kills outright Is that every stone one lifts by day Becomes one's heart by night. With midnight always in one's heart, And twilight in one's cell, We turn the crank, or tear the rope, Each in his separate Hell, And the silence is more awful far Than the sound of a brazen bell. And never a human voice comes near To speak a gentle word And the eye that watches through the door Is pitiless and hard And by all forgot, we rot and rot, With soul and body marred. And thus we rust Life's iron chain Degraded and alone And some men curse, and some men weep, And some men make no moan But God's eternal Laws are kind And break the heart of stone. And every human heart that breaks, In prison-cell or yard, Is as that broken box that gave Its treasure to the Lord, And filled the unclean leper's house With the scent of costliest nard. Ah happy day they whose hearts can break And peace of pardon win How else may man make straight his plan And cleanse his soul from Sin How else but through a broken heart May Lord Christ enter in And he of the swollen purple throat. And the stark and staring eyes, Waits for the holy hands that took The Thief to Paradise And a broken and a contrite heart The Lord will not despise. The man in red who reads the Law Gave him three weeks of life, Three little weeks in which to heal His soul of his soul's strife, And cleanse from every blot of blood The hand that held the knife. And with tears of blood he cleansed the hand, The hand that held the steel For only blood can wipe out blood, And only tears can heal And the crimson stain that was of Cain Became Christ's snow-white seal. VI In Reading gaol by Reading town There is a pit of shame, And in it lies a wretched man Eaten by teeth of flame, In burning winding-sheet he lies, And his grave has got no name. And there, till Christ call forth the dead, In silence let him lie No need to waste the foolish tear, Or heave the windy sigh The man had killed the thing he loved, And so he had to die. And all men kill the thing they love, By all let this be heard, Some do it with a bitter look, Some with a flattering word, The coward does it with a kiss, The brave man with a sword\n",

Reading it, however, with a perfect contempt for it, one discovers that there is in it after all, a place for the genuine. Hands that can grasp, eyes that can dilate, hair that can rise if it must, these things are important not because a high-sounding interpretation can be put upon them but because they are useful when they become so derivative as to become unintelligible, the same thing may be said for all of usthat we do not admire what we cannot understand.

One must make a distinction however when dragged into prominence by half poets, the result is not poetry, nor till the autocrats among us can be literalists of the imaginationabove insolence and triviality and can present for inspection, imaginary gardens with real toads in them, shall we have it. In the meantime, if you demand on the one hand, in defiance of their opinion the raw material of poetry in all its rawness, and that which is on the other hand, genuine, then you are interested in poetry.\n",

A plain without a feature, bare and brown, No blade of grass, no sign of neighborhood, Nothing to eat and nowhere to sit down, Yet, congregated on its blankness, stood An unintelligible multitude, A million eyes, a million boots in line, Without expression, waiting for a sign. Out of the air a voice without a face Proved by statistics that some cause was just In tones as dry and level as the place No one was cheered and nothing was discussed Column by column in a cloud of dust They marched away enduring a belief Whose logic brought them, somewhere else, to grief. She looked over his shoulder For ritual pieties, White flower-garlanded heifers, Libation and sacrifice, But there on the shining metal Where the altar should have been, She saw by his flickering forge-light Quite another scene. Barbed wire enclosed an arbitrary spot Where bored officials lounged one cracked a joke And sentries sweated for the day was hot A crowd of ordinary decent folk Watched from without and neither moved nor spoke As three pale figures were led forth and bound To three posts driven upright in the ground. The mass and majesty of this world, all That carries weight and always weighs the same Lay in the hands of others they were small And could not hope for help and no help came What their foes liked to do was done, their shame Was all the worst could wish they lost their pride And died as men before their bodies died. She looked over his shoulder For athletes at their games, Men and women in a dance Moving their sweet limbs Quick, quick, to music, But there on the shining shield His hands had set no dancing-floor But a weed-choked field. A ragged urchin, aimless and alone, Loitered about that vacancy a bird Flew up to safety from his well-aimed stone That girls are raped, that two boys knife a third, Were axioms to him, who'd never heard Of any world where promises were kept, Or one could weep because another wept. The thin-lipped armorer, Hephaestos, hobbled away, Thetis of the shining breasts Cried out in dismay At what the god had wrought To please her son, the strong Iron-hearted man-slaying Achilles Who would not live long.\n",

I slipped my feet into them as though into two cases knitted with threads of twilight and goatskin. Violent socks, my feet were two fish made of wool, two long sharks sea-blue, shot through by one golden thread, two immense blackbirds, two cannons my feet were honored in this way by these heavenly socks. They were so handsome for the first time my feet seemed to me unacceptable like two decrepit firemen, firemen unworthy of that woven fire, of those glowing socks. Nevertheless I resisted the sharp temptation to save them somewhere as schoolboys keep fireflies, as learned men collect sacred texts, I resisted the mad impulse to put them into a golden cage and each day give them birdseed and pieces of pink melon. Like explorers in the jungle who hand over the very rare green deer to the spit and eat it with remorse, I stretched out my feet and pulled on the magnificent socks and then my shoes. The moral of my ode is this beauty is twice beauty and what is good is doubly good when it is a matter of two socks made of wool in winter.\n",

She talked to him. Then we called her other sons just for the fun of it. Then we called my dad and he and she spoke for a while in Arabic and found out of course they had ten shared friends. Then I thought just for the heck of it why not call some Palestinian poets I know She was laughing a lot by then. Telling of her life, patting my knee, answering questions. She had pulled a sack of homemade mamool cookieslittle powdered sugar crumbly mounds stuffed with dates and nutsfrom her bagand was offering them to all the women at the gate. To my amazement, not a single woman declined one. It was like a sacrament. The traveler from Argentina, the mom from California, the lovely woman from Laredowe were all covered with the same powdered And then the airline broke out free apple juice from huge coolers and two little girls from our flight ran around serving it and they were covered with powdered sugar, too. And I noticed my new best friend by now we were holding handshad a potted plant poking out of her bag, some medicinal thing, with green furry leaves. Such an old country tradi- tion. Always carry a plant. Always stay rooted to somewhere. And I looked around that gate of late and weary ones and I thought, This is the world I want to live in. The shared world.

His hair is crisp, and black, and long His face is like the tanHis brow is wet with honest sweat, He earns whate'er he can,And looks the whole world in the face, For he owes not any man. Week in, week out, from morn till night, You can hear his bellows blowYou can hear him swing his heavy sledge, With measured beat and slow,Like a sexton ringing the village bell, When the evening sun is low. And children coming home from school Look in at the open doorThey love to see the flaming forge, And hear the bellows roar,And catch the burning sparks that fly Like chaff from a threshing-floor. He goes on Sunday to the church, And sits among his boysHe hears the parson pray and preach, He hears his daughter's voiceSinging in the village choir, And it makes his heart rejoice. It sounds to him like her mother's voice Singing in ParadiseHe needs must think of her once more, How in the grave she liesAnd with his hard, rough hand he wipes A tear out of his eyes. Toiling,rejoicing,sorrowing, Onward through life he goesEach morning sees some task begin, Each evening sees it closeSomething attempted, something done, Has earned a night's repose. Thanks, thanks to thee, my worthy friend, For the lesson thou hast taughtThus at the flaming forge of life Our fortunes must be wroughtThus on its sounding anvil shaped Each burning deed and thought.

The waves beside them danced, but they Out-did the sparkling waves in glee A Poet could not but be gay In such a jocund company I gazedand gazedbut little thought What wealth the show to me had brought For oft when on my couch I lie In vacant or in pensive mood, They flash upon that inward eye Which is the bliss of solitude, And then my heart with pleasure fills, And dances with the Daffodils.\n",

Let us go then, you and I, When the evening is spread out against the sky Like a patient etherized upon a table Let us go, through certain half-deserted streets, The muttering retreats Of restless nights in one-night cheap hotels And sawdust restaurants with oyster-shells Streets that follow like a tedious argument Of insidious intent To lead you to an overwhelming question Oh, do not ask, What is it Let us go and make our visit. In the room the women come and go Talking of Michelangelo. The yellow fog that rubs its back upon the window-panes, The yellow smoke that rubs its muzzle on the window-panes Licked its tongue into the corners of the evening, Lingered upon the pools that stand in drains, Let fall upon its back the soot that falls from chimneys, Slipped by the terrace, made a sudden leap, And seeing that it was a soft October night, Curled once about the house, and fell asleep. And indeed there will be time For the yellow smoke that slides along the street, Rubbing its back upon the window-panes There will be time, there will be time To prepare a face to meet the faces that you meet There will be time to murder and create, And time for all the works and days of hands That lift and drop a question on your plate Time for you and time for me, And time yet for a hundred indecisions, And for a hundred visions and revisions, Before the taking of a toast and tea. In the room the women come and go Talking of Michelangelo. And indeed there will be time To wonder, Do I dare and, Do I dare Time to turn back and descend the stair, With a bald spot in the middle of my hair They will say How his hair is growing thin My morning coat, my collar mounting firmly to the chin, My necktie rich and modest, but asserted by a simple pin They will say But how his arms and legs are thin Do I dare Disturb the universe In a minute there is time For decisions and revisions which a minute will reverse. For I have known them all already, known them all Have known the evenings, mornings, afternoons, I have measured out my life with coffee spoons I know the voices dying with a dying fall Beneath the music from a farther room. So how should I presume And I have known the eyes already, known them all The eyes that fix you in a formulated phrase, And when I am formulated, sprawling on a pin, When I am pinned and wriggling on the wall, Then how should I begin To spit out all the butt-ends of my days and ways And how should I presume And I have known the arms already, known them all Arms that are braceleted and white and bare But in the lamplight, downed with light brown hair Is it perfume from a dress That makes me so digress Arms that lie along a table, or wrap about a shawl. And should I then presume And how should I begin..... Shall I say, I have gone at dusk through narrow streets And watched the smoke that rises from the pipes Of lonely men in shirt-sleeves, leaning out of windows I should have been a pair of ragged claws Scuttling across the floors of silent seas...... And the afternoon, the evening, sleeps so peacefully Smoothed by long fingers, Asleep tired or it malingers, Stretched on the floor, here beside you and me. Should I, after tea and cakes and ices, Have the strength to force the moment to its crisis But though I have wept and fasted, wept and prayed, Though I have seen my head grown slightly bald brought in upon a platter, I am no prophetand heres no great matter I have seen the moment of my greatness flicker, And I have seen the eternal Footman hold my coat, and snicker, And in short, I was afraid. And would it have been worth it, after all, After the cups, the marmalade, the tea, Among the porcelain, among some talk of you and me, Would it have been worth while, To have bitten off the matter with a smile, To have squeezed the universe into a ball To roll it toward some overwhelming question, To say I am Lazarus, come from the dead, Come back to tell you all, I shall tell you all If one, settling a pillow by her head, Should say That is not what I meant at all. That is not it, at all. And would it have been worth it, after all, Would it have been worth while, After the sunsets and the dooryards and the sprinkled streets, After the novels, after the teacups, after the skirts that trail along the floor And this, and so much more It is impossible to say just what I mean But as if a magic lantern threw the nerves in patterns on a screen Would it have been worth while If one, settling a pillow or throwing off a shawl, And turning toward the window, should say That is not it at all, That is not what I meant, at all...... No I am not Prince Hamlet, nor was meant to be Am an attendant lord, one that will do To swell a progress, start a scene or two, Advise the prince no doubt, an easy tool, Deferential, glad to be of use, Politic, cautious, and meticulous Full of high sentence, but a bit obtuse At times, indeed, almost ridiculous Almost, at times, the Fool. I grow old I grow old I shall wear the bottoms of my trousers rolled. Shall I part my hair behind Do I dare to eat a peach I shall wear white flannel trousers, and walk upon the beach. I have heard the mermaids singing, each to each. I do not think that they will sing to me. I have seen them riding seaward on the waves Combing the white hair of the waves blown back When the wind blows the water white and black. We have lingered in the chambers of the sea By sea-girls wreathed with seaweed red and brown Till human voices wake us, and we drown.\n",

            "Bent double, like old beggars under sacks, Knock-kneed, coughing like hags, we cursed through sludge, Till on the haunting flares we turned our backs And towards our distant rest began to trudge. Men marched asleep. Many had lost their boots But limped on, blood-shod. All went lame all blind Drunk with fatigue deaf even to the hoots Of tired, outstripped Five-Nines that dropped behind. Gas Gas Quick, boysAn ecstasy of fumbling, Fitting the clumsy helmets just in time But someone still was yelling out and stumbling And flound'ring like a man in fire or lime... Dim, through the misty panes and thick green light, As under a green sea, I saw him drowning. In all my dreams, before my helpless sight, He plunges at me, guttering, choking, drowning. If in some smothering dreams you too could pace Behind the wagon that we flung him in, And watch the white eyes writhing in his face, His hanging face, like a devil's sick of sin If you could hear, at every jolt, the blood Come gargling from the froth-corrupted lungs, Obscene as cancer, bitter as the cud Of vile, incurable sores on innocent tongues, My friend, you would not tell with such high zest To children ardent for some desperate glory, The old Lie Dulce et decorum est Pro patria mori\n",

Solemn the drums thrill Death august and royal Sings sorrow up into immortal spheres. There is a music in the midst of desolation And a glory that shines upon our tears. They went with songs to the battle, they were young, Straight of limb, true of eye, steady and aglow. They were staunch to the end against odds uncountered They fell with their faces to the foe. They shall grow not old, as we that are left grow old Age shall not weary them, nor the years condemn. At the going down of the sun and in the morning We will remember them. They mingle not with their laughing comrades again They sit no more at familiar tables at home They have no lot in our labour of the day-time They sleep beyond Englands foam. But where our desires are and our hopes profound, Felt as a well-spring that is hidden from sight, To the innermost heart of their own land they are known As the stars are known to the Night As the stars that shall be bright when we are dust, Moving in marches upon the heavenly plain As the stars are starry in the time of our darkness, To the end, to the end they remain.\n",

            "This Chanticleer stood high upon his toes, Stretching his neck, and both his eyes did close, And so did crow right loudly, for the nonce And Russel Fox, he started up at once, And by the gorget grabbed our Chanticleer, Flung him on back, and toward the wood did steer, For there was no man who as yet pursued. O destiny, you cannot be eschewed Alas, that Chanticleer flew from the beams Alas, his wife recked nothing of his dreams This simple widow and her daughters two Heard these hens cry and make so great ado, And out of doors they started on the run And saw the fox into the grove just gone, Bearing in his mouth the cock away. And then they cried, Alas, and weladay Oh, the fox and after him they ran, And after them, with staves, went many a man Ran Coll, our dog, and Talbot and Garland, Ran cow and calf and even the very hogs, So were they scared by barking of the dogs And shouting men and women all did make, They all ran so they thought their hearts would break. And now, good men, I pray you hearken all. Behold how Fortune turns all suddenly The hope and pride of even her enemy This cock, which now lay in the foxs mouth, In all his fear unto the fox did clack And say Sir, were I you, as I should be, Then would I say as God may now help me, Turn back again, presumptuous peasants all A very pestilence upon you fall Now that I've gained here to this dark woods side, In spite of you this cock shall here abide. Ill eat him, by my faith, and that anon The fox replied In faith, it shall be done And as he spoke that word, all suddenly This cock broke from his mouth, full cleverly, And high upon a tree he flew anon. And when the fox saw well that he was gone, Alas, quoth he, O Chanticleer, alas I have against you done a base trespass Inasmuch as I made you afeared When I seized you and brought you from the yard But, sir, I did it with no foul intent Come down, and I will tell you what I meant. Ill tell the truth to you, God help me so Nay then, said he, beshrew us both, you know, But first, beshrew myself, both blood and bones, If you beguile me, having done so once, You shall no more, with any flattery, Cause me to sing and closeup either eye For he who shuts his eyes when he should see, And wilfully, God let him neer be free Nay, said the fox, but God give him mischance Who is so indiscreet in governance He chatters when he ought to hold his peace. But you that hold this tale a foolery, As but about a fox, a cock, a hen, Yet do not miss the moral, my good men. For Saint Paul says that all that's written well Is written down some useful truth to tell. Then take the wheat and let the chaff lie still. And now, good God, and if it be Thy will, As says Lord Christ, so make us all good men And bring us into His high bliss. Amen.\n",

            "And God stepped out on space, And he looked around and said I'm lonely I'll make me a world. And far as the eye of God could see Darkness covered everything, Blacker than a hundred midnights Down in a cypress swamp. Then God smiled, And the light broke, And the darkness rolled up on one side, And the light stood shining on the other, And God said That's good Then God reached out and took the light in his hands, And God rolled the light around in his hands Until he made the sun And he set that sun a-blazing in the heavens. And the light that was left from making the sun God gathered it up in a shining ball And flung it against the darkness, Spangling the night with the moon and stars. Then down between The darkness and the light He hurled the world And God said That's good Then God himself stepped down And the sun was on his right hand, And the moon was on his left The stars were clustered about his head, And the earth was under his feet. And God walked, and where he trod His footsteps hollowed the valleys out And bulged the mountains up. Then he stopped and looked and saw That the earth was hot and barren. So God stepped over to the edge of the world And he spat out the seven seas He batted his eyes, and the lightnings flashed He clapped his hands, and the thunders rolled And the waters above the earth came down, The cooling waters came down. Then the green grass sprouted, And the little red flowers blossomed, The pine tree pointed his finger to the sky, And the oak spread out his arms, The lakes cuddled down in the hollows of the ground, And the rivers ran down to the sea And God smiled again, And the rainbow appeared, And curled itself around his shoulder. Then God raised his arm and he waved his hand Over the sea and over the land, And he said Bring forth Bring forth And quicker than God could drop his hand, Fishes and fowls And beasts and birds Swam the rivers and the seas, Roamed the forests and the woods, And split the air with their wings. And God said That's good Then God walked around, And God looked around On all that he had made. He looked at his sun, And he looked at his moon, And he looked at his little stars He looked on his world With all its living things, And God said I'm lonely still. Then God sat down On the side of a hill where he could think By a deep, wide river he sat down With his head in his hands, God thought and thought, Till he thought I'll make me a man Up from the bed of the river God scooped the clay And by the bank of the river He kneeled him down And there the great God Almighty Who lit the sun and fixed it in the sky, Who flung the stars to the most far corner of the night, Who rounded the earth in the middle of his hand This great God, Like a mammy bending over her baby, Kneeled down in the dust Toiling over a lump of clay Till he shaped it in is his own image Then into it he blew the breath of life, And man became a living soul.

Hear the mellow wedding bells, Golden bells What a world of happiness their harmony foretells Through the balmy air of night How they ring out their delight From the molten-golden notes, And all in tune, What a liquid ditty floats To the turtle-dove that listens, while she gloats On the moon Oh, from out the sounding cells, What a gush of euphony voluminously wells How it swells How it dwells On the Future how it tells Of the rapture that impels To the swinging and the ringing Of the bells, bells, bells, Of the bells, bells, bells, bells, Bells, bells, bells To the rhyming and the chiming of the bells Hear the loud alarum bells Brazen bells What tale of terror, now, their turbulency tells In the startled ear of night How they scream out their affright Too much horrified to speak, They can only shriek, shriek, Out of tune, In a clamorous appealing to the mercy of the fire, In a mad expostulation with the deaf and frantic fire, Leaping higher, higher, higher, With a desperate desire, And a resolute endeavor Nownow to sit or never, By the side of the pale-faced moon. Oh, the bells, bells, bells What a tale their terror tells Of Despair How they clang, and clash, and roar What a horror they outpour On the bosom of the palpitating air Yet the ear it fully knows, By the twanging, And the clanging, How the danger ebbs and flows Yet the ear distinctly tells, In the jangling, And the wrangling. How the danger sinks and swells, By the sinking or the swelling in the anger of the bells Of the bells Of the bells, bells, bells, bells, Bells, bells, bells In the clamor and the clangor of the bells Hear the tolling of the bells Iron bells What a world of solemn thought their monody compels In the silence of the night, How we shiver with affright At the melancholy menace of their tone For every sound that floats From the rust within their throats Is a groan. And the peopleah, the people They that dwell up in the steeple, All alone, And who tolling, tolling, tolling, In that muffled monotone, Feel a glory in so rolling On the human heart a stone They are neither man nor woman They are neither brute nor human They are Ghouls And their king it is who tolls And he rolls, rolls, rolls, Rolls A pæan from the bells And his merry bosom swells With the pæan of the bells And he dances, and he yells Keeping time, time, time, In a sort of Runic rhyme, To the pæan of the bells Of the bells Keeping time, time, time, In a sort of Runic rhyme, To the throbbing of the bells Of the bells, bells, bells To the sobbing of the bells Keeping time, time, time, As he knells, knells, knells, In a happy Runic rhyme, To the rolling of the bells Of the bells, bells, bells To the tolling of the bells, Of the bells, bells, bells, bells Bells, bells, bells To the moaning and the groaning of the bells.\n",

I am having to do this not like Cousteau with his assiduous team aboard the sun-flooded schooner but here alone. There is a ladder. The ladder is always there hanging innocently close to the side of the schooner. We know what it is for, we who have used it. Otherwise it is a piece of maritime floss some sundry equipment. I go down. Rung after rung and still the oxygen immerses me the blue light the clear atoms of our human air. I go down. My flippers cripple me, I crawl like an insect down the ladder and there is no one to tell me when the ocean will begin. First the air is blue and then it is bluer and then green and then black I am blacking out and yet my mask is powerful it pumps my blood with power the sea is another story the sea is not a question of power I have to learn alone to turn my body without force in the deep element. And now it is easy to forget what I came for among so many who have always lived here swaying their crenellated fans between the reefs and besides you breathe differently down here. I came to explore the wreck. The words are purposes. The words are maps. I came to see the damage that was done and the treasures that prevail. I stroke the beam of my lamp slowly along the flank of something more permanent than fish or weed the thing I came for the wreck and not the story of the wreck the thing itself and not the myth the drowned face always staring toward the sun the evidence of damage worn by salt and sway into this threadbare beauty the ribs of the disaster curving their assertion among the tentative haunters. This is the place. And I am here, the mermaid whose dark hair streams black, the merman in his armored body. We circle silently about the wreck we dive into the hold. I am she I am he whose drowned face sleeps with open eyes whose breasts still bear the stress whose silver, copper, vermeil cargo lies obscurely inside barrels half-wedged and left to rot we are the half-destroyed instruments that once held to a course the water-eaten log the fouled compass We are, I am, you are by cowardice or courage the one who find our way back to this scene carrying a knife, a camera a book of myths in which our names do not appear.\n",

I thrust my hoe in the mellow ground, Blade-end up and five feet tall, And plod I go up to the stone wall For a friendly visit.\n",

            "And a woman spoke, saying, Tell us of Pain. And he said Your pain is the breaking of the shell that encloses your understanding. Even as the stone of the fruit must break, that its heart may stand in the sun, so must you know pain. And could you keep your heart in wonder at the daily miracles of your life your pain would not seem less wondrous than your joy And you would accept the seasons of your heart, even as you have always accepted the seasons that pass over your fields. And you would watch with serenity through the winters of your grief. Much of your pain is self-chosen. It is the bitter potion by which the physician within you heals your sick self. Therefore trust the physician, and drink his remedy in silence and tranquility For his hand, though heavy and hard, is guided by the tender hand of the Unseen, And the cup he brings, though it burn your lips, has been fashioned of the clay which the Potter has moistened with His own sacred tears.\n",

            "The curfew tolls the knell of parting day, The lowing herd winds slowly o'er the lea, The ploughman homeward plods his weary way, And leaves the world to darkness and to me. Now fades the glimmering landscape on the sight, And all the air a solemn stillness holds, Save where the beetle wheels his droning flight, And drowsy tinklings lull the distant folds Save that from yonder ivy-mantled tower The moping owl does to the moon complain Of such as, wandering near her secret bower, Molest her ancient solitary reign. Beneath those rugged elms, that yew-tree's shade Where heaves the turf in many a mouldering heap, Each in his narrow cell for ever laid, The rude Forefathers of the hamlet sleep. The breezy call of incense-breathing morn, The swallow twittering from the straw-built shed, The cock's shrill clarion, or the echoing horn, No more shall rouse them from their lowly bed. For them no more the blazing hearth shall burn Or busy housewife ply her evening care No children run to lisp their sire's return, Or climb his knees the envied kiss to share. Oft did the harvest to their sickle yield, Their furrow oft the stubborn glebe has broke How jocund did they drive their team afield How bow'd the woods beneath their sturdy stroke Let not Ambition mock their useful toil, Their homely joys, and destiny obscure Nor Grandeur hear with a disdainful smile The short and simple annals of the Poor. The boast of heraldry, the pomp of power, And all that beauty, all that wealth e'er gave Awaits alike th' inevitable hour The paths of glory lead but to the grave. Nor you, ye Proud, impute to these the fault If Memory o'er their tomb no trophies raise, Where through the long-drawn aisle and fretted vault The pealing anthem swells the note of praise. Can storied urn or animated bust Back to its mansion call the fleeting breath, Can Honour's voice provoke the silent dust, Or Flattery soothe the dull cold ear of Death Perhaps in this neglected spot is laid Some heart once pregnant with celestial fire Hands, that the rod of empire might have sway'd, Or waked to ecstasy the living lyre But Knowledge to their eyes her ample page, Rich with the spoils of time, did ne'er unroll Chill Penury repress'd their noble rage, And froze the genial current of the soul. Full many a gem of purest ray serene The dark unfathom'd caves of ocean bear Full many a flower is born to blush unseen, And waste its sweetness on the desert air. Some village-Hampden, that with dauntless breast The little tyrant of his fields withstood, Some mute inglorious Milton here may rest, Some Cromwell, guiltless of his country's blood. Th' applause of listening senates to command, The threats of pain and ruin to despise, To scatter plenty o'er a smiling land, And read their history in a nation's eyes Their lot forbad nor circumscribed alone Their growing virtues, but their crimes confined Forbad to wade through slaughter to a throne, And shut the gates of mercy on mankind The struggling pangs of conscious truth to hide, To quench the blushes of ingenuous shame, Or heap the shrine of Luxury and Pride With incense kindled at the Muse's flame. Far from the madding crowd's ignoble strife Their sober wishes never learn'd to stray Along the cool sequester'd vale of life They kept the noiseless tenour of their way. Yet e'en these bones from insult to protect Some frail memorial still erected nigh, With uncouth rhymes and shapeless sculpture deck'd, Implores the passing tribute of a sigh. Their name, their years, spelt by th' unletter'd Muse, The place of fame and elegy supply And many a holy text around she strews, That teach the rustic moralist to die. For who, to dumb forgetfulness a prey, This pleasing anxious being e'er resign'd, Left the warm precincts of the cheerful day, Nor cast one longing lingering look behind On some fond breast the parting soul relies, Some pious drops the closing eye requires E'en from the tomb the voice of Nature cries, E'en in our ashes live their wonted fires. For thee, who, mindful of th' unhonour'd dead, Dost in these lines their artless tale relate If chance, by lonely Contemplation led, Some kindred spirit shall enquire thy fate, Haply some hoary-headed swain may say, 'Oft have we seen him at the peep of dawn Brushing with hasty steps the dews away, To meet the sun upon the upland lawn 'There at the foot of yonder nodding beech That wreathes its old fantastic roots so high, His listless length at noon-tide would he stretch, And pore upon the brook that babbles by. 'Hard by yon wood, now smiling as in scorn, Muttering his wayward fancies he would rove Now drooping, woeful-wan, like one forlorn, Or crazed with care, or cross'd in hopeless love. 'One morn I miss'd him on the custom'd hill, Along the heath, and near his favourite tree Another came nor yet beside the rill, Nor up the lawn, nor at the wood was he 'The next with dirges due in sad array Slow through the church-way path we saw him borne, Approach and read for thou canst read the lay Graved on the stone beneath yon agèd thorn' The Epitaph Here rests his head upon the lap of Earth A youth, to Fortune and to Fame unknown Fair Science frown'd not on his humble birth And Melancholy mark'd him for her own. Large was his bounty, and his soul sincere Heaven did a recompense as largely send He gave to Mis'ry all he had, a tear, He gain'd from Heaven, 'twas all he wish'd, a friend. No farther seek his merits to disclose, Or draw his frailties from their dread abode, There they alike in trembling hope repose, The bosom of his Father and his God.\n",

            "A Rock, A River, A Tree Hosts to species long since departed, Marked the mastodon, The dinosaur, who left dried tokens Of their sojourn here On our planet floor, Any broad alarm of their hastening doom Is lost in the gloom of dust and ages. But today, the Rock cries out to us, clearly, forcefully, Come, you may stand upon my Back and face your distant destiny, But seek no haven in my shadow. I will give you no hiding place down here. You, created only a little lower than The angels, have crouched too long in The bruising darkness Have lain too long Face down in ignorance. Your mouths spilling words Armed for slaughter. The Rock cries out to us today, you may stand upon me, But do not hide your face. Across the wall of the world, A River sings a beautiful song. It says, Come, rest here by my side. Each of you, a bordered country, Delicate and strangely made proud, Yet thrusting perpetually under siege. Your armed struggles for profit Have left collars of waste upon My shore, currents of debris upon my breast. Yet today I call you to my riverside, If you will study war no more. Come, Clad in peace, and I will sing the songs The Creator gave to me when I and the Tree and the rock were one. Before cynicism was a bloody sear across your Brow and when you yet knew you still Knew nothing. The River sang and sings on. There is a true yearning to respond to The singing River and the wise Rock. So say the Asian, the Hispanic, the Jew The African, the Native American, the Sioux, The Catholic, the Muslim, the French, the Greek The Irish, the Rabbi, the Priest, the Sheik, The Gay, the Straight, the Preacher, The privileged, the homeless, the Teacher. They hear. They all hear The speaking of the Tree. They hear the first and last of every Tree Speak to humankind today. Come to me, here beside the River. Plant yourself beside the River. Each of you, descendant of some passed On traveller, has been paid for. You, who gave me my first name, you, Pawnee, Apache, Seneca, you Cherokee Nation, who rested with me, then Forced on bloody feet, Left me to the employment of Other seekersdesperate for gain, Starving for gold. You, the Turk, the Arab, the Swede, the German, the Eskimo, the Scot, You the Ashanti, the Yoruba, the Kru, bought, Sold, stolen, arriving on the nightmare Praying for a dream. Here, root yourselves beside me. I am that Tree planted by the River, Which will not be moved. I, the Rock, I the River, I the Tree I am yoursyour passages have been paid. Lift up your faces, you have a piercing need For this bright morning dawning for you. History, despite its wrenching pain Cannot be unlived, but if faced With courage, need not be lived again. Lift up your eyes upon This day breaking for you. Give birth again To the dream. Women, children, men, Take it into the palms of your hands, Mold it into the shape of your most Private need. Sculpt it into The image of your most public self. Lift up your hearts Each new hour holds new chances For a new beginning. Do not be wedded forever To fear, yoked eternally To brutishness. The horizon leans forward, Offering you space to place new steps of change. Here, on the pulse of this fine day You may have the courage To look up and out and upon me, the Rock, the River, the Tree, your country. No less to Midas than the mendicant. No less to you now than the mastodon then. Here, on the pulse of this new day You may have the grace to look up and out And into your sisters eyes, and into Your brothers face, your country And say simply Very simply With hope Good morning.\n",

And as I was green and carefree, famous among the barns About the happy yard and singing as the farm was home, In the sun that is young once only, Time let me play and be Golden in the mercy of his means, And green and golden I was huntsman and herdsman, the calves Sang to my horn, the foxes on the hills barked clear and cold, And the sabbath rang slowly In the pebbles of the holy streams. All the sun long it was running, it was lovely, the hay Fields high as the house, the tunes from the chimneys, it was air And playing, lovely and watery And fire green as grass. And nightly under the simple stars As I rode to sleep the owls were bearing the farm away, All the moon long I heard, blessed among stables, the nightjars Flying with the ricks, and the horses Flashing into the dark. And then to awake, and the farm, like a wanderer white With the dew, come back, the cock on his shoulder it was all Shining, it was Adam and maiden, The sky gathered again And the sun grew round that very day. So it must have been after the birth of the simple light In the first, spinning place, the spellbound horses walking warm Out of the whinnying green stable On to the fields of praise. And honoured among foxes and pheasants by the gay house Under the new made clouds and happy as the heart was long, In the sun born over and over, I ran my heedless ways, My wishes raced through the house high hay And nothing I cared, at my sky blue trades, that time allows In all his tuneful turning so few and such morning songs Before the children green and golden Follow him out of grace, Nothing I cared, in the lamb white days, that time would take me Up to the swallow thronged loft by the shadow of my hand, In the moon that is always rising, Nor that riding to sleep I should hear him fly with the high fields And wake to the farm forever fled from the childless land. Oh as I was young and easy in the mercy of his means, Time held me green and dying Though I sang in my chains like the sea.\n",

Except for the War till the day he retired He worked in a factory and never got fired, But satisfied his employers, Fudge Motors Inc. Yet he wasn't a scab or odd in his views, For his Union reports that he paid his dues, Our report on his Union shows it was sound And our Social Psychology workers found That he was popular with his mates and liked a drink. The Press are convinced that he bought a paper every day And that his reactions to advertisements were normal in every way. Policies taken out in his name prove that he was fully insured, Both Producers Research and High-Grade Living declare He was fully sensible to the advantages of the Instalment Plan And had everything necessary to the Modern Man, A phonograph, a radio, a car and a frigidaire. Our researchers into Public Opinion are content That he held the proper opinions for the time of year When there was peace, he was for peace when there was war, he went. He was married and added five children to the population, Which our Eugenist says was the right number for a parent of his generation.

Its winter again the skys a deep, headstrong blue, and the sunlight pours through the open living-room windows because the heats on too high in here and I cant turn it off. For weeks now, driving, or dropping a bag of groceries in the street, the bag breaking, Ive been thinking This is what the living do. And yesterday, hurrying along those wobbly bricks in the Cambridge sidewalk, spilling my coffee down my wrist and sleeve, I thought it again, and again later, when buying a hairbrush This is it. Parking. Slamming the car door shut in the cold. What you called that yearning. What you finally gave up. We want the spring to come and the winter to pass. We want whoever to call or not call, a letter, a kisswe want more and more and then more of it. But there are moments, walking, when I catch a glimpse of myself in the window glass, say, the window of the corner video store, and I'm gripped by a cherishing so deep for my own blowing hair, chapped face, and unbuttoned coat that Im speechless I am living.

            "And there are days when storms hover Over my house, their brooding just this side of rage, An open hand about to slap a face. You won't believe me When I tell you it is not personal. It isn't. It only feels That way because the face is yours. So what if it is the only Face you've got Listen, a storm will grab the first thing In its path, a Persian cat, a sixth grade boy on his way home From school, an old woman watering her roses, a black Man running down a street late to a dinner with his wife, A white guy buying cigarettes at the corner store. A storm Will grab a young woman trying to escape her boyfriend, A garbage can, a Mexican busboy with no papers, you. We are all collateral damage for someone's beautiful Ideology, all of us inanimate in the face of the onslaught. My father had the biggest hands I've ever seen. He never Wore a wedding ring. Somehow, it would have looked lost, Misplaced on his thick worker's hands that were, to me, As large as Africa. There have been a good many storms In Africa over the centuries. One was called colonialism Though I confess to loving Tarzan as a boy. In my thirties, I read a book by Frantz Fanon. I fell in love With the storms in his book even though they broke My heart and made me want to scream. What good Is screaming Even a bad actress in a horror flick Can do that. In my twenties, I had fallen in love With the storms in the essays of James Baldwin. They were like perfect poems. His friends called Him Jimmy. People didn't think he was beautiful. Oh God, but he was. He could make a hand that was Slapping you into something that was loving, loving you. He could make rage sound elegant. Have you ever Read Stranger in the Village How would you like To feel like a fucking storm every time someone looked At you One time I was At a party. Some guy asked me What are you, anyway I downed my beer. Mexican I said. Really he said, Do You play soccer No I said but I drink Tequila. He smiled At me, That's cool. I smiled back So what are you What do you think I am he said. An asshole I said. People Hate you when you're right. Especially if you're Mexican. And every time I leave town, I pray that people will stop Repeating You're from El Paso with that same tone Of voice they use when they see a rat running across Their living rooms, interrupting their second glass Of scotch. My father's dead Though sometimes I wake And swear he has never been more aliveespecially when I see him staring back at me as I shave in the morning. Even though I understand something about hating a man I have never really understood the logic of slavery. What do I know I don't particularly like the idea of cheap Labor. I don't like guns. And I don't even believe White men are superior. Do you I wanted to be St. Francis. I took this ambition very seriously. Instead I wound up becoming a middle-aged man who dreams Storms where all the animals wind up dead. It scares Me to think I have this dream inside me. Still, I love dogseven mean ones. I could forgive A dog that bit me. But if a man bit me, that would be Another story. I have made my peace with cats. I am especially in love with hummingbirds though They're as mean as roosters in a cock fight. Have You ever seen the storms in the eyes of men who Were betting on a cock fight Last night, there was hail, thunder, A tornado touching down in the desertthough I was Away and was not a first hand witness. I was in another Place, listening to the waves of the ocean crash against The shore. Sometimes I think the sea is angry. Who Can blame it There are a million things to be angry About. Have you noticed that some people don't give A damn and just keep on shopping Doesn't that make you Angry A storm is like God. You don't have to see it To believesometimes you just have to place Your faith in it. When my father walked into a room It felt like that. Like the crashing waves. You know, Like a storm. This is the truth of the matter I am The son of a storm. Look, every one has to be the son Of something. The thing to do when you are caught In the middle of a storm is to abandon your car, Keep quiet. Pray. Wait. Tell that to the men Who were sleeping on the Arizona when The Japanese dropped their bombs. War is the worst Kind of storm. The truth is I have never met a breathing Human being who did not have at least one scar On his body. Bombs and bullets do more than leave A permanent mark on the skin. I have never liked The expression they were out for blood. There are days When there are so many storms hovering around My house that I cannot even see the blue in the sky. My father loved the sky. He was trying to memorize The clouds before he died. I confess to being Jealous of the sky. On Sunday Mornings I picture Frantz Fanon as an old man. He is looking up At the pure African sky. He is trying to imagine how it appeared Before the white men came. I don't want to dream all the dead Animals we have made extinct. I want to dream a sky Full of hummingbirds. I would like to die in such a storm.\n",

            "When lilacs last in the door-yard bloomd, And the great star early droopd in the western sky in the night, I mourndand yet shall mourn with ever-returning spring. O ever-returning spring trinity sure to me you bring Lilac blooming perennial, and drooping star in the west, And thought of him I love. 2 O powerful, western, fallen star O shades of night O moody, tearful night O great star disappeard O the black murk that hides the star O cruel hands that hold me powerless O helpless soul of me O harsh surrounding cloud, that will not free my soul 3 In the door-yard fronting an old farm-house, near the white-washd palings, Stands the lilac bush, tall-growing, with heart-shaped leaves of rich green, With many a pointed blossom, rising, delicate, with the perfume strong I love, With every leaf a miracle......and from this bush in the door-yard, With delicate-colord blossoms, and heart-shaped leaves of rich green, A sprig, with its flower, I break. 4 In the swamp, in secluded recesses, A shy and hidden bird is warbling a song. Solitary, the thrush, The hermit, withdrawn to himself, avoiding the settlements, Sings by himself a song. Song of the bleeding throat Deaths outlet song of lifefor well, dear brother, I know If thou wast not gifted to sing, thou wouldst surely die. 5 Over the breast of the spring, the land, amid cities, Amid lanes, and through old woods, where lately the violets peepd from the ground, spotting the gray debris Amid the grass in the fields each side of the lanespassing the endless grass Passing the yellow-speard wheat, every grain from its shroud in the dark-brown fields uprising Passing the apple-tree blows of white and pink in the orchards Carrying a corpse to where it shall rest in the grave, Night and day journeys a coffin. 6 Coffin that passes through lanes and streets, Through day and night, with the great cloud darkening the land, With the pomp of the inloopd flags, with the cities draped in black, With the show of the States themselves, as of crape-veild women, standing, With processions long and winding, and the flambeaus of the night, With the countless torches litwith the silent sea of faces, and the unbared heads, With the waiting depot, the arriving coffin, and the sombre faces, With dirges through the night, with the thousand voices rising strong and solemn With all the mournful voices of the dirges, pourd around the coffin, The dim-lit churches and the shuddering organsWhere amid these you journey, With the tolling, tolling bells perpetual clang Here coffin that slowly passes, I give you my sprig of lilac. 7 Nor for you, for one, alone Blossoms and branches green to coffins all I bring For fresh as the morningthus would I carol a song for you, O sane and sacred death. All over bouquets of roses, O death I cover you over with roses and early lilies But mostly and now the lilac that blooms the first, Copious, I break, I break the sprigs from the bushes With loaded arms I come, pouring for you, For you, and the coffins all of you, O death. 8 O western orb, sailing the heaven Now I know what you must have meant, as a month since we walkd, As we walkd up and down in the dark blue so mystic, As we walkd in silence the transparent shadowy night, As I saw you had something to tell, as you bent to me night after night, As you droopd from the sky low down, as if to my side, while the other stars all lookd on As we wanderd together the solemn night, for something, I know not what, kept me from sleep As the night advanced, and I saw on the rim of the west, ere you went, how full you were of woe As I stood on the rising ground in the breeze, in the cold transparent night, As I watchd where you passd and was lost in the netherward black of the night, As my soul, in its trouble, dissatisfied, sank, as where you, sad orb, Concluded, dropt in the night, and was gone. 9 Sing on, there in the swamp O singer bashful and tender I hear your notesI hear your call I hearI come presentlyI understand you But a moment I lingerfor the lustrous star has detaind me The star, my departing comrade, holds and detains me. 10 O how shall I warble myself for the dead one there I loved And how shall I deck my song for the large sweet soul that has gone And what shall my perfume be, for the grave of him I love Sea-winds, blown from east and west, Blown from the eastern sea, and blown from the western sea, till there on the prairies meeting These, and with these, and the breath of my chant, I perfume the grave of him I love. 11 O what shall I hang on the chamber walls And what shall the pictures be that I hang on the walls, To adorn the burial-house of him I love Pictures of growing spring, and farms, and homes, With the Fourth-month eve at sundown, and the gray smoke lucid and bright, With floods of the yellow gold of the gorgeous, indolent, sinking sun, burning, expanding the air With the fresh sweet herbage under foot, and the pale green leaves of the trees prolific In the distance the flowing glaze, the breast of the river, with a wind-dapple here and there With ranging hills on the banks, with many a line against the sky, and shadows And the city at hand, with dwellings so dense, and stacks of chimneys, And all the scenes of life, and the workshops, and the workmen homeward returning. 12 Lo body and soul this land Mighty Manhattan, with spires, and the sparkling and hurrying tides, and the ships The varied and ample landthe South and the North in the lightOhios shores, and flashing Missouri, And ever the far-spreading prairies, coverd with grass and corn. Lo the most excellent sun, so calm and haughty The violet and purple morn, with just-felt breezes The gentle, soft-born, measureless light The miracle, spreading, bathing allthe fulfilld noon The coming eve, deliciousthe welcome night, and the stars, Over my cities shining all, enveloping man and land. 13 Sing on sing on, you gray-brown bird Sing from the swamps, the recessespour your chant from the bushes Limitless out of the dusk, out of the cedars and pines. Sing on, dearest brotherwarble your reedy song Loud human song, with voice of uttermost woe. O liquid, and free, and tender O wild and loose to my soul O wondrous singer You only I hear......yet the star holds me, but will soon depart Yet the lilac, with mastering odor, holds me. 14 Now while I sat in the day, and lookd forth, In the close of the day, with its light, and the fields of spring, and the farmer preparing his crops, In the large unconscious scenery of my land, with its lakes and forests, In the heavenly aerial beauty, after the perturbd winds, and the storms Under the arching heavens of the afternoon swift passing, and the voices of children and women, The many-moving sea-tides,and I saw the ships how they saild, And the summer approaching with richness, and the fields all busy with labor, And the infinite separate houses, how they all went on, each with its meals and minutia of daily usages And the streets, how their throbbings throbbd, and the cities pentlo then and there, Falling upon them all, and among them all, enveloping me with the rest, Appeard the cloud, appeard the long black trail And I knew Death, its thought, and the sacred knowledge of death. 15 Then with the knowledge of death as walking one side of me, And the thought of death close-walking the other side of me, And I in the middle, as with companions, and as holding the hands of companions, I fled forth to the hiding receiving night, that talks not, Down to the shores of the water, the path by the swamp in the dimness, To the solemn shadowy cedars, and ghostly pines so still. And the singer so shy to the rest receivd me The gray-brown bird I know, receivd us comrades three And he sang what seemd the carol of death, and a verse for him I love. From deep secluded recesses, From the fragrant cedars, and the ghostly pines so still, Came the carol of the bird. And the charm of the carol rapt me, As I held, as if by their hands, my comrades in the night And the voice of my spirit tallied the song of the bird. 16 DEATH CAROL. Come, lovely and soothing Death, Undulate round the world, serenely arriving, arriving, In the day, in the night, to all, to each, Sooner or later, delicate Death. Praisd be the fathomless universe, For life and joy, and for objects and knowledge curious And for love, sweet loveBut praise praise praise For the sure-enwinding arms of cool-enfolding Death. Dark Mother, always gliding near, with soft feet, Have none chanted for thee a chant of fullest welcome Then I chant it for theeI glorify thee above all I bring thee a song that when thou must indeed come, come unfalteringly. Approach, strong Deliveress When it is sowhen thou hast taken them, I joyously sing the dead, Lost in the loving, floating ocean of thee, Laved in the flood of thy bliss, O Death. From me to thee glad serenades, Dances for thee I propose, saluting theeadornments and feastings for thee And the sights of the open landscape, and the high-spread sky, are fitting, And life and the fields, and the huge and thoughtful night. The night, in silence, under many a star The ocean shore, and the husky whispering wave, whose voice I know And the soul turning to thee, O vast and well-veild Death, And the body gratefully nestling close to thee. Over the tree-tops I float thee a song Over the rising and sinking wavesover the myriad fields, and the prairies wide Over the dense-packd cities all, and the teeming wharves and ways, I float this carol with joy, with joy to thee, O Death 17 To the tally of my soul, Loud and strong kept up the gray-brown bird, With pure, deliberate notes, spreading, filling the night. Loud in the pines and cedars dim, Clear in the freshness moist, and the swamp-perfume And I with my comrades there in the night. While my sight that was bound in my eyes unclosed, As to long panoramas of visions. 18 I saw askant the armies And I saw, as in noiseless dreams, hundreds of battle-flags Borne through the smoke of the battles, and piercd with missiles, I saw them, And carried hither and yon through the smoke, and torn and bloody And at last but a few shreds left on the staffs, and all in silence, And the staffs all splinterd and broken. I saw battle-corpses, myriads of them, And the white skeletons of young menI saw them I saw the debris and debris of all the dead soldiers of the war But I saw they were not as was thought They themselves were fully at restthey sufferd not The living remaind and sufferdthe mother sufferd, And the wife and the child, and the musing comrade sufferd, And the armies that remaind sufferd. 19 Passing the visions, passing the night Passing, unloosing the hold of my comrades hands Passing the song of the hermit bird, and the tallying song of my soul, Victorious song, deaths outlet song, yet varying, ever-altering song, As low and wailing, yet clear the notes, rising and falling, flooding the night, Sadly sinking and fainting, as warning and warning, and yet again bursting with joy, Covering the earth, and filling the spread of the heaven, As that powerful psalm in the night I heard from recesses, Passing, I leave thee, lilac with heart-shaped leaves I leave thee there in the door-yard, blooming, returning with spring, I cease from my song for thee From my gaze on thee in the west, fronting the west, communing with thee, O comrade lustrous, with silver face in the night. 20 Yet each I keep, and all, retrievements out of the night The song, the wondrous chant of the gray-brown bird, And the tallying chant, the echo arousd in my soul, With the lustrous and drooping star, with the countenance full of woe, With the lilac tall, and its blossoms of mastering odor With the holders holding my hand, nearing the call of the bird, Comrades mine, and I in the midst, and their memory ever I keepfor the dead I loved so well For the sweetest, wisest soul of all my days and lands...and this for his dear sake Lilac and star and bird, twined with the chant of my soul, There in the fragrant pines, and the cedars dusk and dim.\n",

            "Midway upon the journey of our life I found myself within a forest dark, For the straightforward pathway had been lost. Ah me how hard a thing it is to say What was this forest savage, rough, and stern, Which in the very thought renews the fear. So bitter is it, death is little more But of the good to treat, which there I found, Speak will I of the other things I saw there. I cannot well repeat how there I entered, So full was I of slumber at the moment In which I had abandoned the true way. But after I had reached a mountains foot, At that point where the valley terminated, Which had with consternation pierced my heart, Upward I looked, and I beheld its shoulders, Vested already with that planets rays Which leadeth others right by every road. Then was the fear a little quieted That in my hearts lake had endured throughout The night, which I had passed so piteously. And even as he, who, with distressful breath, Forth issued from the sea upon the shore, Turns to the water perilous and gazes So did my soul, that still was fleeing onward, Turn itself back to re-behold the pass Which never yet a living person left. After my weary body I had rested, The way resumed I on the desert slope, So that the firm foot ever was the lower. And lo almost where the ascent began, A panther light and swift exceedingly, Which with a spotted skin was covered oer And never moved she from before my face, Nay, rather did impede so much my way, That many times I to return had turned. The time was the beginning of the morning, And up the sun was mounting with those stars That with him were, what time the Love Divine At first in motion set those beauteous things So were to me occasion of good hope, The variegated skin of that wild beast, The hour of time, and the delicious season But not so much, that did not give me fear A lions aspect which appeared to me. He seemed as if against me he were coming With head uplifted, and with ravenous hunger, So that it seemed the air was afraid of him And a she-wolf, that with all hungerings Seemed to be laden in her meagreness, And many folk has caused to live forlorn She brought upon me so much heaviness, With the affright that from her aspect came, That I the hope relinquished of the height. And as he is who willingly acquires, And the time comes that causes him to lose, Who weeps in all his thoughts and is despondent, E'en such made me that beast withouten peace, Which, coming on against me by degrees Thrust me back thither where the sun is silent. While I was rushing downward to the lowland, Before mine eyes did one present himself, Who seemed from long-continued silence hoarse. When I beheld him in the desert vast, Have pity on me, unto him I cried, Whicheer thou art, or shade or real man He answered me Not man man once I was, And both my parents were of Lombardy, And Mantuans by country both of them. Sub Julio was I born, though it was late, And lived at Rome under the good Augustus, During the time of false and lying gods. A poet was I, and I sang that just Son of Anchises, who came forth from Troy, After that Ilion the superb was burned. But thou, why goest thou back to such annoyance Why climbst thou not the Mount Delectable, Which is the source and cause of every joy Now, art thou that Virgilius and that fountain Which spreads abroad so wide a river of speech I made response to him with bashful forehead. O, of the other poets honour and light, Avail me the long study and great love That have impelled me to explore thy volume Thou art my master, and my author thou, Thou art alone the one from whom I took The beautiful style that has done honour to me. Behold the beast, for which I have turned back Do thou protect me from her, famous Sage, For she doth make my veins and pulses tremble. Thee it behoves to take another road, Responded he, when he beheld me weeping, If from this savage place thou wouldst escape Because this beast, at which thou criest out, Suffers not any one to pass her way, But so doth harass him, that she destroys him And has a nature so malign and ruthless, That never doth she glut her greedy will, And after food is hungrier than before. Many the animals with whom she weds, And more they shall be still, until the Greyhound Comes, who shall make her perish in her pain. He shall not feed on either earth or pelf, But upon wisdom, and on love and virtue 'Twixt Feltro and Feltro shall his nation be Of that low Italy shall he be the saviour, On whose account the maid Camilla died, Euryalus, Turnus, Nisus, of their wounds Through every city shall he hunt her down, Until he shall have driven her back to Hell, There from whence envy first did let her loose. Therefore I think and judge it for thy best Thou follow me, and I will be thy guide, And lead thee hence through the eternal place, Where thou shalt hear the desperate lamentations, Shalt see the ancient spirits disconsolate, Who cry out each one for the second death And thou shalt see those who contented are Within the fire, because they hope to come, Wheneer it may be, to the blessed people To whom, then, if thou wishest to ascend, A soul shall be for that than I more worthy With her at my departure I will leave thee Because that Emperor, who reigns above, In that I was rebellious to his law, Wills that through me none come into his city. He governs everywhere, and there he reigns There is his city and his lofty throne O happy he whom thereto he elects And I to him Poet, I thee entreat, By that same God whom thou didst never know, So that I may escape this woe and worse, Thou wouldst conduct me there where thou hast said, That I may see the portal of Saint Peter, And those thou makest so disconsolate. Then he moved on, and I behind him followed.\n",

            "Date: 1861\n",
            "Listen, my children, and you shall hear Of the midnight ride of Paul Revere, On the eighteenth of April, in Seventy-Five Hardly a man is now alive Who remembers that famous day and year. He said to his friend, If the British march By land or sea from the town to-night, Hang a lantern aloft in the belfry-arch Of the North-Church-tower, as a signal-light, One if by land, and two if by sea And I on the opposite shore will be, Ready to ride and spread the alarm Through every Middlesex village and farm, For the country-folk to be up and to arm. Then he said Good night and with muffled oar Silently rowed to the Charlestown shore, Just as the moon rose over the bay, Where swinging wide at her moorings lay The Somerset, British man-of-war A phantom ship, with each mast and spar Across the moon, like a prison-bar, And a huge black hulk, that was magnified By its own reflection in the tide. Meanwhile, his friend, through alley and street Wanders and watches with eager ears, Till in the silence around him he hears The muster of men at the barrack door, The sound of arms, and the tramp of feet, And the measured tread of the grenadiers Marching down to their boats on the shore. Then he climbed to the tower of the church, Up the wooden stairs, with stealthy tread, To the belfry-chamber overhead, And startled the pigeons from their perch On the sombre rafters, that round him made Masses and moving shapes of shade, By the trembling ladder, steep and tall, To the highest window in the wall, Where he paused to listen and look down A moment on the roofs of the town, And the moonlight flowing over all. Beneath, in the churchyard, lay the dead, In their night-encampment on the hill, Wrapped in silence so deep and still That he could hear, like a sentinels tread, The watchful night-wind, as it went Creeping along from tent to tent, And seeming to whisper, All is well A moment only he feels the spell Of the place and the hour, and the secret dread Of the lonely belfry and the dead For suddenly all his thoughts are bent On a shadowy something far away, Where the river widens to meet the bay, A line of black, that bends and floats On the rising tide, like a bridge of boats. Meanwhile, impatient to mount and ride, Booted and spurred, with a heavy stride, On the opposite shore walked Paul Revere. Now he patted his horses side, Now gazed on the landscape far and near, Then impetuous stamped the earth, And turned and tightened his saddle-girth But mostly he watched with eager search The belfry-tower of the old North Church, As it rose above the graves on the hill, Lonely and spectral and sombre and still. And lo as he looks, on the belfrys height, A glimmer, and then a gleam of light He springs to the saddle, the bridle he turns, But lingers and gazes, till full on his sight A second lamp in the belfry burns A hurry of hoofs in a village-street, A shape in the moonlight, a bulk in the dark, And beneath from the pebbles, in passing, a spark Struck out by a steed that flies fearless and fleet That was all And yet, through the gloom and the light, The fate of a nation was riding that night And the spark struck out by that steed, in his flight, Kindled the land into flame with its heat. He has left the village and mounted the steep, And beneath him, tranquil and broad and deep, Is the Mystic, meeting the ocean tides And under the alders, that skirt its edge, Now soft on the sand, now loud on the ledge, Is heard the tramp of his steed as he rides. It was twelve by the village clock When he crossed the bridge into Medford town. He heard the crowing of the cock, And the barking of the farmers dog, And felt the damp of the river-fog, That rises when the sun goes down. It was one by the village clock, When he galloped into Lexington. He saw the gilded weathercock Swim in the moonlight as he passed, And the meeting-house windows, blank and bare, Gaze at him with a spectral glare, As if they already stood aghast At the bloody work they would look upon. It was two by the village clock, When he came to the bridge in Concord town. He heard the bleating of the flock, And the twitter of birds among the trees, And felt the breath of the morning breeze Blowing over the meadows brown. And one was safe and asleep in his bed Who at the bridge would be first to fall, Who that day would be lying dead, Pierced by a British musket-ball. You know the rest. In the books you have read, How the British Regulars fired and fled, How the farmers gave them ball for ball, From behind each fence and farmyard-wall, Chasing the red-coats down the lane, Then crossing the fields to emerge again Under the trees at the turn of the road, And only pausing to fire and load. So through the night rode Paul Revere And so through the night went his cry of alarm To every Middlesex village and farm, A cry of defiance, and not of fear, A voice in the darkness, a knock at the door, And a word that shall echo forevermore For, borne on the night-wind of the Past, Through all our history, to the last, In the hour of darkness and peril and need, The people will waken and listen to hear The hurrying hoof-beats of that steed, And the midnight message of Paul Revere.\n",

I was a child and she was a child, In this kingdom by the sea But we loved with a love that was more than love I and my Annabel Lee With a love that the winged seraphs of heaven Coveted her and me. And this was the reason that, long ago, In this kingdom by the sea, A wind blew out of a cloud, chilling My beautiful Annabel Lee So that her highborn kinsman came And bore her away from me, To shut her up in a sepulchre In this kingdom by the sea. The angels, not half so happy in heaven, Went envying her and me Yesthat was the reason as all men know, In this kingdom by the sea That the wind came out of the cloud by night, Chilling and killing my Annabel Lee. But our love it was stronger by far than the love Of those who were older than we Of many far wiser than we And neither the angels in heaven above, Nor the demons down under the sea, Can ever dissever my soul from the soul Of the beautiful Annabel Lee For the moon never beams, without bringing me dreams Of the beautiful Annabel Lee And the stars never rise, but I feel the bright eyes Of the beautiful Annabel Lee And so, all the night-tide, I lie down by the side Of my darlingmy darlingmy life and my bride, In her sepulchre there by the sea, In her tomb by the sounding sea.\n",

Its story is old, the plot worn and the pages too, But we read this book, anyway, over and again Giving is, first and every time, hand to hand, Mine to yours, yours to mine. You gave me blue and I gave you yellow. Together we are simple green. You gave me What you did not have, and I gave you What I had to givetogether, we made Something greater from the difference.\n",

My nose is cold, my toes are numb. I have a sliver in my thumb. My neck is stiff, my voice is weak, I hardly whisper when I speak. My tongue is filling up my mouth, I think my hair is falling out. My elbow's bent, my spine ain't straight, My temperature is one-o-eight. My brain is shrunk, I cannot hear, There is a hole inside my ear.

O Captain my Captain rise up and hear the bells Rise up- for you the flag is flung- for you the bugle trills, For you bouquets and ribbond wreaths- for you the shores a-crowding, For you they call, the swaying mass, their eager faces turning Here Captain dear father This arm beneath your head It is some dream that on the deck, Youve fallen cold and dead. My Captain does not answer, his lips are pale and still, My father does not feel my arm, he has no pulse nor will, The ship is anchord safe and sound, its voyage closed and done, From fearful trip the victor ship comes in with object won Exult O shores, and ring O bells But I with mournful tread, Walk the deck my Captain lies, Fallen cold and dead.\n",

The Burial of the Dead April is the cruellest month, breeding Lilacs out of the dead land, mixing Memory and desire, stirring Dull roots with spring rain. Winter kept us warm, covering Earth in forgetful snow, feeding A little life with dried tubers. Summer surprised us, coming over the Starnbergersee With a shower of rain we stopped in the colonnade, And went on in sunlight, into the Hofgarten, And drank coffee, and talked for an hour. Bin gar keine Russin, stamm aus Litauen, echt deutsch. And when we were children, staying at the archdukes, My cousins, he took me out on a sled, And I was frightened. He said, Marie, Marie, hold on tight. And down we went. In the mountains, there you feel free. I read, much of the night, and go south in the winter. What are the roots that clutch, what branches grow Out of this stony rubbish Son of man, You cannot say, or guess, for you know only A heap of broken images, where the sun beats, And the dead tree gives no shelter, the cricket no relief, And the dry stone no sound of water. Only There is shadow under this red rock, Come in under the shadow of this red rock, And I will show you something different from either Your shadow at morning striding behind you Or your shadow at evening rising to meet you I will show you fear in a handful of dust.

Öd und leer das Meer. Madame Sosostris, famous clairvoyante, Had a bad cold, nevertheless Is known to be the wisest woman in Europe, With a wicked pack of cards. Here, said she, Is your card, the drowned Phoenician Sailor, Those are pearls that were his eyes. Look Here is Belladonna, the Lady of the Rocks, The lady of situations. Here is the man with three staves, and here the Wheel, And here is the one-eyed merchant, and this card, Which is blank, is something he carries on his back, Which I am forbidden to see. I do not find The Hanged Man. Fear death by water. I see crowds of people, walking round in a ring. Thank you. If you see dear Mrs. Equitone, Tell her I bring the horoscope myself One must be so careful these days. Unreal City, Under the brown fog of a winter dawn, A crowd flowed over London Bridge, so many, I had not thought death had undone so many. Sighs, short and infrequent, were exhaled, And each man fixed his eyes before his feet. Flowed up the hill and down King William Street, To where Saint Mary Woolnoth kept the hours With a dead sound on the final stroke of nine. There I saw one I knew, and stopped him, crying Stetson You who were with me in the ships at Mylae That corpse you planted last year in your garden, Has it begun to sprout Will it bloom this year Or has the sudden frost disturbed its bed Oh keep the Dog far hence, thats friend to men, Or with his nails hell dig it up again You hypocrite lecteurmon semblable,mon frère II. A Game of Chess The Chair she sat in, like a burnished thone, Glowed on the marble, where the glass Held up by standards wrought with fruited vines From which a golden Cupidon peeped out Another hid his eyes behind his wing Doubled the flames of sevenbranched candelabra Reflecting light upon the table as The glitter of her jewels rose to meet it, From satin cases poured in rich profusion In vials of ivory and coloured glass Unstoppered, lurked her strange synthetic perfumes, Unguent, powdered, or liquidtroubled, confused And drowned the sense in odours stirred by the air That freshened from the window, these ascended In fattening the prolonged candle-flames, Flung their smoke into the laquearia, Stirring the pattern on the coffered ceiling. Huge sea-wood fed with copper Burned green and orange, framed by the coloured stone, In which sad light a carvèd dolphin swam. Above the antique mantel was displayed. As though a window gave upon the sylvan scene The change of Philomel, by the barbarous king So rudely forced yet there the nightingale Filled all the desert with inviolable voice And still she cried, and still the world pursues, Jug Jug to dirty ears. And other withered stumps of time Were told upon the walls staring forms Leaned out, leaning, hushing the room enclosed. Footsteps shuffled on the stair. Under the firelight, under the brush, her hair Spread out in fiery points Clawed into words, then would be savagely still. My nerves are bad tonight. Yes, bad. Stay with me. Speak to me. Why do you never speak. Speak. What are you thinking of What thinking What I never know what you are thinking. Think. I think we are in rats alley Where the dead men lost their bones. What is the noise The wind under the door. What is that noise now What is the wind doing Nothing again nothing. Do You know nothing Do you see nothing Do you remember Nothing I remember Those are pearls that were his eyes. Are you alive, or not Is there nothing in your head But O O O O that Shakespeherian Rag Its so elegant So intelligent What shall I do now What shall I do I shall rush out as I am, and walk the street With my hair down, so. What shall we do tomorrow What shall we ever do The hot water at ten. And if it rains, a closed car at four. And we shall play a game of chess, Pressing lidless eyes and waiting for a knock upon the door.

You have them all out, Lil, and get a nice set, He said, I swear, I cant bear to look at you. And no more cant I, I said, and think of poor Albert, Hes been in the army four years, he wants a good time, And if you dont give it him, there's others will, I said. Oh is there, she said. Something o that, I said. Then Ill know who to thank, she said, and give me a straight look. HURRY UP PLEASE ITS TIME If you dont like it you can get on with it, I said, Others can pick and choose if you cant. But if Albert makes off, it wont be for lack of telling. You ought to be ashamed, I said, to look so antique. And her only thirty-one. I cant help it, she said, pulling a long face, Its them pills I took, to bring it off, she said. Shes had five already, and nearly died of young George. The chemist said it would be alright, but Ive never been the same. You are a proper fool, I said. Well, if Albert wont leave you alone, there it is, I said, What you get married for if you dont want children HURRY UP PLEASE ITS TIME Well, that Sunday Albert was home, they had a hot gammon, And they asked me in to dinner, to get the beauty of it hot HURRY UP PLEASE ITS TIME HURRY UP PLEASE ITS TIME Goonight Bill.

The Fire Sermon The rivers tent is broken the last fingers of leaf Clutch and sink into the wet bank. The wind Crosses the brown land, unheard. The nymphs are departed. Sweet Thames, run softly, till I end my song. The river bears no empty bottles, sandwich papers, Silk handkerchiefs, cardboard boxes, cigarette ends Or other testimony of summer nights. The nymphs are departed. And their friends, the loitering heirs of City directors Departed, have left no addresses. By the waters of Leman I sat down and wept... Sweet Thames, run softly till I end my song, Sweet Thames, run softly, for I speak not loud or long. But at my back in a cold blast I hear The rattle of the bones, and chuckle spread from ear to ear. A rat crept softly through the vegetation Dragging its slimy belly on the bank While I was fishing in the dull canal On a winter evening round behind the gashouse Musing upon the king my brothers wreck And on the king my fathers death before him. White bodies naked on the low damp ground And bones cast in a little low dry garret, Rattled by the rats foot only, year to year. But at my back from time to time I hear The sound of horns and motors, which shall bring Sweeney to Mrs. Porter in the spring. O the moon shone bright on Mrs. Porter And on her daughter They wash their feet in soda water Et O ces voix denfants, chantant dans la coupole Twit twit twit Jug jug jug jug jug jug So rudely forcd. Tereu Unreal City Under the brown fog of a winter noon Mr. Eugenides, the Smyrna merchant Unshaven, with a pocket full of currants C.i.f. London documents at sight, Asked me in demotic French To luncheon at the Cannon Street Hotel Followed by a weekend at the Metropole. At the violet hour, when the eyes and back Turn upward from the desk, when the human engine waits Like a taxi throbbing waiting, I Tiresias, though blind, throbbing between two lives, Old man with wrinkled female breasts, can see At the violet hour, the evening hour that strives Homeward, and brings the sailor home from sea, The typist home at teatime, clears her breakfast, lights Her stove, and lays out food in tins. Out of the window perilously spread Her drying combinations touched by the suns last rays, On the divan are piled at night her bed Stockings, slippers, camisoles, and stays. I Tiresias, old man with wrinkled dugs Perceived the scene, and foretold the rest I too awaited the expected guest. He, the young man carbuncular, arrives, A small house agents clerk, with one bold stare, One of the low on whom assurance sits As a silk hat on a Bradford millionaire, The time is now propitious, as he guesses, The meal is ended, she is bored and tired, Endeavours to engage her in caresses Which still are unreproved, if undesired. Flushed and decided, he assaults at once Exploring hands encounter no defence His vanity requires no response, And makes a welcome of indifference. And I Tiresias have foresuffered all Enacted on this same divan or bed I who have sat by Thebes below the wall And walked among the lowest of the dead. Bestows one final patronising kiss, And gropes his way, finding the stairs unlit... She turns and looks a moment in the glass, Hardly aware of her departed lover Her brain allows one half-formed thought to pass Well now thats done and Im glad its over. When lovely woman stoops to folly and Paces about her room again, alone, She smoothes her hair with automatic hand, And puts a record on the gramophone. This music crept by me upon the waters And along the Strand, up Queen Victoria Street. O City City, I can sometimes hear Beside a public bar in Lower Thames Street, The pleasant whining of a mandoline And a clatter and a chatter from within Where fishmen lounge at noon where the walls Of Magnus Martyr hold Inexplicable splendour of Ionian white and gold. The river sweats Oil and tar The barges drift With the turning tide Red sails Wide To leeward, swing on the heavy spar. The barges wash Drifting logs Down Greenwich reach Past the Isle of Dogs.

He promised a new start. I made no comment. What should I resent On Margate Sands. I can connect Nothing with nothing. The broken fingernails of dirty hands. My people humble people who expect Nothing. la la To Carthage then I came Burning burning burning burning O Lord Thou pluckest me out O Lord Thou pluckest burning IV. Death by Water Phlebas the Phoenician, a fortnight dead, Forgot the cry of gulls, and the deep sea swell And the profit and loss. A current under sea Picked his bones in whispers. As he rose and fell He passed the stages of his age and youth Entering the whirlpool. Gentile or Jew O you who turn the wheel and look to windward, Consider Phlebas, who was once handsome and tall as you. V. What the Thunder Said After the torchlight red on sweaty faces After the frosty silence in the gardens After the agony in stony places The shouting and the crying Prison and palace and reverberation Of thunder of spring over distant mountains He who was living is now dead We who were living are now dying With a little patience Here is no water but only rock Rock and no water and the sandy road The road winding above among the mountains Which are mountains of rock without water If there were water we should stop and drink Amongst the rock one cannot stop or think Sweat is dry and feet are in the sand If there were only water amongst the rock Dead mountain mouth of carious teeth that cannot spit Here one can neither stand nor lie nor sit There is not even silence in the mountains But dry sterile thunder without rain There is not even solitude in the mountains But red sullen faces sneer and snarl From doors of mudcracked houses If there were water And no rock If there were rock And also water And water A spring A pool among the rock If there were the sound of water only Not the cicada And dry grass singing But sound of water over a rock Where the hermit-thrush sings in the pine trees Drip drop drip drop drop drop drop But there is no water Who is the third who walks always beside you When I count, there are only you and I together But when I look ahead up the white road There is always another one walking beside you Gliding wrapt in a brown mantle, hooded I do not know whether a man or a woman But who is that one on the other side of you What is that sound high in the air Murmur of maternal lamentation Who are those hooded hordes swarming Over endless plains, stumbling in cracked earth Ringed by the flat horizon only What is the city over the mountains Cracks and reforms and bursts in the violet air Falling towers Jerusalem Athens Alexandria Vienna London Unreal A woman drew her long black hair out tight And fiddled whisper music on those strings And bats with baby faces in the violet light Whistled, and beat their wings And crawled head downward down a blackened wall And upside down in air were towers Tolling reminiscent bells, that kept the hours And voices singing out of empty cisterns and exhausted wells. In this decayed hole among the mountains In the faint moonlight, the grass is singing Over the tumbled graves, about the chapel There is the empty chapel, only the winds home, It has no windows, and the door swings, Dry bones can harm no one. Only a cock stood on the rooftree Co co rico co co rico In a flash of lightning.

But the poor Dog, in life the firmest friend, The first to welcome, foremost to defend, Whose honest heart is still his Master's own, Who labours, fights, lives, breathes for him alone, Unhonour'd falls, unnotic'd all his worth, Deny'd in heaven the Soul he held on earth While man, vain insect hopes to be forgiven, And claims himself a sole exclusive heaven. Oh man thou feeble tenant of an hour, Debas'd by slavery, or corrupt by power, Who knows thee well, must quit thee with disgust, Degraded mass of animated dust Thy love is lust, thy friendship all a cheat, Thy tongue hypocrisy, thy heart deceit By nature vile, ennobled but by name, Each kindred brute might bid thee blush for shame.

            "Arms and the man I sing, who, forced by fate And haughty Juno's unrelenting hate, Expelled and exiled, left the Trojan shore. Long labors, both by sea and land, he bore And in the doubtful war, before he won The Latin realm and built the destined town, His banished gods restored to rights divine, And settled sure succession in his line From whence the race of Alban fathers come, And the long glories of majestic Rome. O Muse the causes and the crimes relate, What goddess was provok'd, and whence her hate For what offense the Queen of Heav'n began To persecute so brave, so just a man Involv'd his anxious life in endless cares, Expos'd to wants, and hurried into wars Can heav'nly minds such high resentment show, Or exercise their spite in human woe Against the Tiber's mouth, but far away, An ancient town was seated on the sea, A Tyrian colony the people made Stout for the war, and studious of their trade Carthage the name belov'd by Juno more Than her own Argos, or the Samian shore. Here stood her chariot here, if Heav'n were kind, The seat of awful empire she design'd. Yet she had heard an ancient rumor fly, Long cited by the people of the sky, That times to come should see the Trojan race Her Carthage ruin, and her tow'rs deface Nor thus confin'd, the yoke of sov'reign sway Should on the necks of all the nations lay. She ponder'd this, and fear'd it was in fate Nor could forget the war she wag'd of late For conqu'ring Greece against the Trojan state. Besides, long causes working in her mind, And secret seeds of envy, lay behind Deep graven in her heart the doom remain'd Of partial Paris, and her form disdain'd The grace bestow'd on ravish'd Ganymed, Electra's glories, and her injur'd bed. Each was a cause alone and all combin'd To kindle vengeance in her haughty mind. For this, far distant from the Latian coast She drove the remnants of the Trojan host And sev'n long years th' unhappy wand'ring train Were toss'd by storms, and scatter'd thro' the main. Such time, such toil, requir'd the Roman name, Such length of labor for so vast a frame. Now scarce the Trojan fleet with sails and oars Had left behind the fair Sicilian shores, Entering with cheerful shouts the watery reign, And plowing frothy furrows in the main, When, laboring still, with endless discontent The Queen of Heaven did thus her fury vent Then am I vanquished must I yield said she, And must the Trojans reign in Italy So Fate will have it, and Jove adds his force Nor can my power divert their happy course. Could angry Pallas, with revengeful spleen, The Grecian navy burn and drown the men She, for the fault of one offending foe, The bolts of Jove himself presumed to throw With whirlwinds from beneath she tossed the ship And bare exposed the bosom of the deep Then, as an eagle gripes the trembling game, The wretch, yet hissing with her father's flame, She strongly seized, and with a burning wound, Transfixed and naked, on a rock she bound. But I, who walked in awful state above, The majesty of heaven, the sister-wife of Jove, For length of years my fruitless force employ Against the thin remains of ruined Troy. What nations now to Juno's power will pray, Or offerings on my slighted altars lay\n",

            "I am lazy, the laziest girl in the world. I sleep during the day when I want to, 'til my face is creased and swollen, 'til my lips are dry and hot. I eat as I please cookies and milk after lunch, butter and sour cream on my baked potato, foods that slothful people eat, that turn yellow and opaque beneath the skin. Sometimes come dinnertime Sunday I am still in my nightgown, the one with the lace trim listing because I have not mended it. Many days I do not exercise, only consider it, then rub my curdy belly and lie down. Even my poems are lazy. I use syllabics instead of iambs, prefer slant to the gong of full rhyme, write briefly while others go for pages. And yesterday, for example, I did not work at all I got in my car and I drove to factory outlet stores, purchased stockings and panties and socks with my father's money. To think, in childhood I missed only one day of school per year. I went to ballet class four days a week at four-forty-five and on Saturdays, beginning always with plie, ending with curtsy. To think, I knew only industry, the industry of my race and of immigrants, the radio tuned always to the station that said, Line up your summer job months in advance. Work hard and do not shame your family, who worked hard to give you what you have. There is no sin but sloth. Burn to a wick and keep moving. I avoided sleep for years, up at night replaying evening news stories about nearby jailbreaks, fat people who ate fried chicken and woke up dead. In sleep I am looking for poems in the shape of open V's of birds flying in formation, or open arms saying, I forgive you, all.\n",

            "The Naming of Cats is a difficult matter, It isnt just one of your holiday games You may think at first Im as mad as a hatter When I tell you, a cat must have THREE DIFFERENT NAMES. First of all, theres the name that the family use daily, Such as Peter, Augustus, Alonzo, or James, Such as Victor or Jonathan, George or Bill Bailey All of them sensible everyday names. There are fancier names if you think they sound sweeter, Some for the gentlemen, some for the dames Such as Plato, Admetus, Electra, Demeter But all of them sensible everyday names, But I tell you, a cat needs a name thats particular, A name thats peculiar, and more dignified, Else how can he keep up his tail perpendicular, Or spread out his whiskers, or cherish his pride Of names of this kind, I can give you a quorum, Such as Munkustrap, Quaxo, or Coricopat, Such as Bombalurina, or else Jellylorum Names that never belong to more than one cat. But above and beyond theres still one name left over, And that is the name that you never will guess The name that no human research can discover But THE CAT HIMSELF KNOWS, and will never confess. When you notice a cat in profound meditation, The reason, I tell you, is always the same His mind is engaged in a rapt contemplation Of the thought, of the thought, of the thought of his name His ineffable effable Effanineffable Deep and inscrutable singular name.\n",

Look, we are not unspectacular things. Weve come this far, survived this much. What would happen if we decided to survive more To love harder What if we stood up with our synapses and flesh and said, No. No, to the rising tides. Stood for the many mute mouths of the sea, of the land What would happen if we used our bodies to bargain for the safety of others, for earth, if we declared a clean night, if we stopped being terrified, if we launched our demands into the sky, made ourselves so big people could point to us with the arrows they make in their minds,\n",

There shrines and palaces and towers Time-eaten towers and tremble not Resemble nothing that is ours. Around, by lifting winds forgot, Resignedly beneath the sky The melancholy waters lie. No rays from the holy Heaven come down On the long night-time of that town But light from out the lurid sea Streams up the turrets silently Gleams up the pinnacles far and free Up domesup spiresup kingly halls Up fanesup Babylon-like walls Up shadowy long-forgotten bowers Of sculptured ivy and stone flowers Up many and many a marvellous shrine Whose wreathed friezes intertwine The viol, the violet, and the vine. Resignedly beneath the sky The melancholy waters lie. So blend the turrets and shadows there That all seem pendulous in air, While from a proud tower in the town Death looks gigantically down. There open fanes and gaping graves Yawn level with the luminous waves But not the riches there that lie In each idols diamond eye Not the gaily-jewelled dead Tempt the waters from their bed For no ripples curl, alas Along that wilderness of glass No swellings tell that winds may be Upon some far-off happier sea No heavings hint that winds have been On seas less hideously serene. But lo, a stir is in the air The wavethere is a movement there As if the towers had thrust aside, In slightly sinking, the dull tide As if their tops had feebly given A void within the filmy Heaven. The waves have now a redder glow The hours are breathing faint and low And when, amid no earthly moans, Down, down that town shall settle hence, Hell, rising from a thousand thrones, Shall do it reverence.\n",

What instruments we have agree The day of his death was a dark cold day. Far from his illness The wolves ran on through the evergreen forests, The peasant river was untempted by the fashionable quays By mourning tongues The death of the poet was kept from his poems. But for him it was his last afternoon as himself, An afternoon of nurses and rumours The provinces of his body revolted, The squares of his mind were empty, Silence invaded the suburbs, The current of his feeling failed he became his admirers. Now he is scattered among a hundred cities And wholly given over to unfamiliar affections, To find his happiness in another kind of wood And be punished under a foreign code of conscience. The words of a dead man Are modified in the guts of the living. But in the importance and noise of to-morrow When the brokers are roaring like beasts on the floor of the bourse, And the poor have the sufferings to which they are fairly accustomed And each in the cell of himself is almost convinced of his freedom A few thousand will think of this day As one thinks of a day when one did something slightly unusual.

Mad Ireland hurt you into poetry. Now Ireland has her madness and her weather still, For poetry makes nothing happen it survives In the valley of its making where executives Would never want to tamper, flows on south From ranches of isolation and the busy griefs, Raw towns that we believe and die in it survives, A way of happening, a mouth. III Earth, receive an honoured guest William Yeats is laid to rest. Let the Irish vessel lie Emptied of its poetry. In the nightmare of the dark All the dogs of Europe bark, And the living nations wait, Each sequestered in its hate Intellectual disgrace Stares from every human face, And the seas of pity lie Locked and frozen in each eye. Follow, poet, follow right To the bottom of the night, With your unconstraining voice Still persuade us to rejoice With the farming of a verse Make a vineyard of the curse, Sing of human unsuccess In a rapture of distress In the deserts of the heart Let the healing fountain start, In the prison of his days Teach the free man how to praise.\n",

I was already yoursthe anti-urge, the mutilator of souls. 2 BOTTLES Elavil, Ludiomil, Doxepin, Norpramin, Prozac, Lithium, Xanax, Wellbutrin, Parnate, Nardil, Zoloft. The coated ones smell sweet or have no smell the powdery ones smell like the chemistry lab at school that made me hold my breath. 3 SUGGESTION FROM A FRIEND You wouldn't be so depressed if you really believed in God. 4 OFTEN Often I go to bed as soon after dinner as seems adult I mean I try to wait for dark in order to push away from the massive pain in sleep's frail wicker coracle. 5 ONCE THERE WAS LIGHT Once, in my early thirties, I saw that I was a speck of light in the great river of light that undulates through time. I was floating with the whole human family. We were all colorsthose who are living now, those who have died, those who are not yet born. For a few moments I floated, completely calm, and I no longer hated having to exist. Like a crow who smells hot blood you came flying to pull me out of the glowing stream. I'll hold you up. I never let my dear ones drown After that, I wept for days. 6 IN AND OUT The dog searches until he finds me upstairs, lies down with a clatter of elbows, puts his head on my foot. Sometimes the sound of his breathing saves my lifein and out, in and out a pause, a long sigh.... 7 PARDON A piece of burned meat wears my clothes, speaks in my voice, dispatches obligations haltingly, or not at all. It is tired of trying to be stouthearted, tired beyond measure. We move on to the monoamine oxidase inhibitors. Day and night I feel as if I had drunk six cups of coffee, but the pain stops abruptly. With the wonder and bitterness of someone pardoned for a crime she did not commit I come back to marriage and friends, to pink fringed hollyhocks come back to my desk, books, and chair. 8 CREDO Pharmaceutical wonders are at work but I believe only in this moment of well-being. Unholy ghost, you are certain to come again. Coarse, mean, you'll put your feet on the coffee table, lean back, and turn me into someone who can't take the trouble to speak someone who can't sleep, or who does nothing but sleep can't read, or call for an appointment for help. There is nothing I can do against your coming. When I awake, I am still with thee. 9 WOOD THRUSH High on Nardil and June light I wake at four, waiting greedily for the first note of the wood thrush. Easeful air presses through the screen with the wild, complex song of the bird, and I am overcome by ordinary contentment. What hurt me so terribly all my life until this moment How I love the small, swiftly beating heart of the bird singing in the great maples its bright, unequivocal eye.\n",

            "And death shall have no dominion. Dead men naked they shall be one With the man in the wind and the west moon When their bones are picked clean and the clean bones gone, They shall have stars at elbow and foot Though they go mad they shall be sane, Though they sink through the sea they shall rise again Though lovers be lost love shall not And death shall have no dominion. And death shall have no dominion. Under the windings of the sea They lying long shall not die windily Twisting on racks when sinews give way, Strapped to a wheel, yet they shall not break Faith in their hands shall snap in two, And the unicorn evils run them through Split all ends up they shan't crack And death shall have no dominion. And death shall have no dominion. No more may gulls cry at their ears Or waves break loud on the seashores Where blew a flower may a flower no more Lift its head to the blows of the rain Though they be mad and dead as nails, Heads of the characters hammer through daisies Break in the sun till the sun breaks down, And death shall have no dominion.\n",

They name thee before me, A knell to mine ear A shudder comes o'er me Why wert thou so dear They know not I knew thee, Who knew thee too well Long, long shall I rue thee, Too deeply to tell. In secret we met In silence I grieve, That thy heart could forget, Thy spirit deceive. If I should meet thee After long years, How should I greet thee With silence and tears.\n",

            "One summer she goes into the field as usual stopping for a bit at the pool where she often looks at herself, to see if she detects any changes. She sees the same person, the horrible mantle of daughterliness still clinging to her. The sun seems, in the water, very close. That's my uncle spying again, she thinks everything in nature is in some way her relative. I am never alone, she thinks, turning the thought into a prayer. Then death appears, like the answer to a prayer. No one understands anymore how beautiful he was. But Persephone remembers. Also that he embraced her, right there, with her uncle watching. She remembers sunlight flashing on his bare arms. This is the last moment she remembers clearly. Then the dark god bore her away. She also remembers, less clearly, the chilling insight that from this moment she couldn't live without him again. The girl who disappears from the pool will never return. A woman will return, looking for the girl she was. She stands by the pool saying, from time to time, I was abducted, but it sounds wrong to her, nothing like what she felt. Then she says, I was not abducted. Then she says, I offered myself, I wanted to escape my body. Even, sometimes, I willed this. But ignorance cannot will knowledge. Ignorance wills something imagined, which it believes exists. All the different nouns she says them in rotation. Death, husband, god, stranger. Everything sounds so simple, so conventional. I must have been, she thinks, a simple girl. She can't remember herself as that person but she keeps thinking the pool will remember and explain to her the meaning of her prayer so she can understand whether it was answered or not.\n",

            "Beside a stricken field I stood On the torn turf, on grass and wood, Hung heavily the dew of blood. Still in their fresh mounds lay the slain, But all the air was quick with pain And gusty sighs and tearful rain. Two angels, each with drooping head And folded wings and noiseless treads, Watched by that valley of the dead. The one, with forehead saintly bland And lips of blessing, not command, Leaned, weeping, on her olive wand. The others brows were scarred and knit, His restless eyes were watch-fires lit, His hands for battle-gauntlets fit. How longI knew the voice of Peace, Is there no respite no release When shall the hopeless quarrel cease O Lord, how long One human soul Is more than any parchment scroll, Or any flag thy winds unroll. What price was Ellsworths, young and brave How weigh the gift that Lyon gave, Or count the cost of Winthrops grave O brother if thine eye can see, Tell how and when the end shall be, What hope remains for thee and me. Then Freedom sternly said I shun No strife nor pang beneath the sun, When human rights are staked and won. I knelt with Ziskas hunted flock, I watched in Toussaints cell of rock, I walked with Sidney to the block. The moor of Marston felt my tread, Through Jersey snows the march I led, My voice Magentas charges sped. But now, through weary day and night, I watch a vague and aimless fight For leave to strike one blow aright. On either side my foe they own One guards through love his ghastly throne, And one through fear to reverence grown. Why wait we longer, mocked, betrayed, By open foes, or those afraid To speed thy coming through my aid Why watch to see who win or fall I shake the dust against them all, I leave them to their senseless brawl. Nay, Peace implored yet longer wait The doom is near, the stake is great God knoweth if it be too late. Still wait and watch the way prepare Where I with folded wings of prayer May follow, weaponless and bare. Too late the stern, sad voice replied, Too late its mournful echo sighed, In low lament the answer died. A rustling as of wings in flight, An upward gleam of lessening white, So passed the vision, sound and sight. But round me, like a silver bell Rung down the listening sky to tell Of holy help, a sweet voice fell. Still hope and trust, it sang the rod Must fall, the wine-press must be trod, But all is possible with God This poem is in the public domain.\n",

            "A Poem for Barack Obamas Presidential Inauguration January 21, 2013 One sun rose on us today, kindled over our shores, peeking over the Smokies, greeting the faces of the Great Lakes, spreading a simple truth across the Great Plains, then charging across the Rockies. One light, waking up rooftops, under each one, a story told by our silent gestures moving behind windows. My face, your face, millions of faces in mornings mirrors, each one yawning to life, crescendoing into our day pencil-yellow school buses, the rhythm of traffic lights, fruit stands apples, limes, and oranges arrayed like rainbows begging our praise. Silver trucks heavy with oil or paper bricks or milk, teeming over highways alongside us, on our way to clean tables, read ledgers, or save lives to teach geometry, or ring-up groceries as my mother did for twenty years, so I could write this poem. All of us as vital as the one light we move through, the same light on blackboards with lessons for the day equations to solve, history to question, or atoms imagined, the I have a dream we keep dreaming, or the impossible vocabulary of sorrow that wont explain the empty desks of twenty children marked absent today, and forever. Many prayers, but one light breathing color into stained glass windows, life into the faces of bronze statues, warmth onto the steps of our museums and park benches as mothers watch children slide into the day. One ground. Our ground, rooting us to every stalk of corn, every head of wheat sown by sweat and hands, hands gleaning coal or planting windmills in deserts and hilltops that keep us warm, hands digging trenches, routing pipes and cables, hands as worn as my fathers cutting sugarcane so my brother and I could have books and shoes. The dust of farms and deserts, cities and plains mingled by one windour breath. Breathe. Hear it through the days gorgeous din of honking cabs, buses launching down avenues, the symphony of footsteps, guitars, and screeching subways, the unexpected song bird on your clothes line. Hear squeaky playground swings, trains whistling, or whispers across café tables, Hear the doors we open for each other all day, saying hello shalom, buon giorno howdy namaste or buenos días in the language my mother taught mein every language spoken into one wind carrying our lives without prejudice, as these words break from my lips. One sky since the Appalachians and Sierras claimed their majesty, and the Mississippi and Colorado worked their way to the sea. Thank the work of our hands weaving steel into bridges, finishing one more report for the boss on time, stitching another wound or uniform, the first brush stroke on a portrait, or the last floor on the Freedom Tower jutting into a sky that yields to our resilience. One sky, toward which we sometimes lift our eyes tired from work some days guessing at the weather of our lives, some days giving thanks for a love that loves you back, sometimes praising a mother who knew how to give, or forgiving a father who couldnt give what you wanted. We head home through the gloss of rain or weight of snow, or the plum blush of dusk, but alwayshome, always under one sky, our sky. And always one moon like a silent drum tapping on every rooftop and every window, of one countryall of us facing the stars hopea new constellation waiting for us to map it, waiting for us to name ittogether\n",

            "Mine are the night and morning, The pits of air, the gulf of space, The sportive sun, the gibbous moon, The innumerable days. I hid in the solar glory, I am dumb in the pealing song, I rest on the pitch of the torrent, In slumber I am strong. No numbers have counted my tallies, No tribes my house can fill, I sit by the shining Fount of Life, And pour the deluge still And ever by delicate powers Gathering along the centuries From race on race the rarest flowers, My wreath shall nothing miss. And many a thousand summers My apples ripened well, And light from meliorating stars With firmer glory fell. I wrote the past in characters Of rock and fire the scroll, The building in the coral sea, The planting of the coal. And thefts from satellites and rings And broken stars I drew, And out of spent and aged things I formed the world anew What time the gods kept carnival, Tricked out in star and flower, And in cramp elf and saurian forms They swathed their too much power. Time and Thought were my surveyors, They laid their courses well, They boiled the sea, and baked the layers Or granite, marl, and shell. But he, the man-child glorious, Where tarries he the while The rainbow shines his harbinger, The sunset gleams his smile. My boreal lights leap upward, Forthright my planets roll, And still the man-child is not born, The summit of the whole. Must time and tide forever run Will never my winds go sleep in the west Will never my wheels which whirl the sun And satellites have rest Too much of donning and doffing, Too slow the rainbow fades, I weary of my robe of snow, My leaves and my cascades I tire of globes and races, Too long the game is played What without him is summer's pomp, Or winters frozen shade I travail in pain for him, My creatures travail and wait His couriers come by squadrons, He comes not to the gate. Twice I have moulded an image, And thrice outstretched my hand, Made one of day, and one of night, And one of the salt sea-sand. One in a Judaean manger, And one by Avon stream, One over against the mouths of Nile, And one in the Academe. I moulded kings and saviours, And bards oer kings to rule But fell the starry influence short, The cup was never full. Yet whirl the glowing wheels once more, And mix the bowl again Seethe, fate the ancient elements, Heat, cold, wet, dry, and peace, and pain. Let war and trade and creeds and song Blend, ripen race on race, The sunburnt world a man shall breed Of all the zones, and countless days. No ray is dimmed, no atom worn, My oldest force is good as new, And the fresh rose on yonder thorn Gives back the bending heavens in dew.\n",

Oh, I kept the first for another day Yet knowing how way leads on to way, I doubted if I should ever come back.

            "The sun was shining on the sea, Shining with all his might He did his very best to make The billows smooth and bright And this was odd, because it was The middle of the night. The moon was shining sulkily, Because she thought the sun Had got no business to be there After the day was done It's very rude of him, she said, To come and spoil the fun The sea was wet as wet could be, The sands were dry as dry. You could not see a cloud because No cloud was in the sky No birds were flying overhead There were no birds to fly. The Walrus and the Carpenter Were walking close at hand They wept like anything to see Such quantities of sand If this were only cleared away, They said, it would be grand If seven maids with seven mops Swept it for half a year, Do you suppose, the Walrus said, That they could get it clear I doubt it, said the Carpenter, And shed a bitter tear. 0 Oysters, come and walk with us The Walrus did beseech. A pleasant walk, a pleasant talk, Along the briny beach We cannot do with more than four, To give a hand to each. The eldest Oyster looked at him, But never a word he said The eldest Oyster winked his eye, And shook his heavy head Meaning to say he did not choose To leave the oyster-bed. But four young Oysters hurried up, All eager for the treat Their coats were brushed, their faces washed, Their shoes were clean and neat And this was odd, because, you know, They hadn't any feet. Four other Oysters followed them, And yet another four And thick and fast they came at last, And more and more and more All hopping through the frothy waves, And scrambling to the shore. The Walrus and the Carpenter Walked on a mile or so, And then they rested on a rock Conveniently low And all the little Oysters stood And waited in a row. The time has come, the Walrus said, To talk of many things Of shoesand shipsand sealing-wax Of cabbagesand kings And why the sea is boiling hot And whether pigs have wings. But wait a bit, the Oysters cried, Before we have our chat For some of us are out of breath, And all of us are fat No hurry said the Carpenter. They thanked him much for that. A loaf of bread, the Walrus said, Is what we chiefly need Pepper and vinegar besides Are very good indeed Now, if you're ready, Oysters dear, We can begin to feed. But not on us the Oysters cried, Turning a little blue. After such kindness, that would be A dismal thing to do The night is fine, the Walrus said, Do you admire the view It was so kind of you to come And you are very nice The Carpenter said nothing but Cut us another slice. I wish you were not quite so deaf I've had to ask you twice It seems a shame, the Walrus said, To play them such a trick. After we've brought them out so far, And made them trot so quick The Carpenter said nothing but The butter's spread too thick I weep for you, the Walrus said I deeply sympathize. With sobs and tears he sorted out Those of the largest size, Holding his pocket-handkerchief Before his streaming eyes. 0 Oysters, said the Carpenter, You've had a pleasant run Shall we be trotting home again But answer came there none And this was scarcely odd, because They'd eaten every one.\n",

            "Or a Vision in a Dream. A Fragment In Xanadu did Kubla Khan A stately pleasure dome decree Where Alph, the sacred river, ran Through caverns measureless to man Down to a sunless sea. So twice five miles of fertile ground With walls and towers were girdled round And there were gardens bright with sinuous rills, Where blossomed many an incense-bearing tree And here were forests ancient as the hills, Enfolding sunny spots of greenery. But oh that deep romantic chasm which slanted Down the green hill athwart a cedarn cover A savage place as holy and enchanted As e'er beneath a waning moon was haunted By woman wailing for her demon lover And from this chasm, with ceaseless turmoil seething, As if this earth in fast thick pants were breathing, A mighty fountain momently was forced Amid whose swift half-intermitted burst Huge fragments vaulted like rebounding hail, Or chaffy grain beneath the thresher's flail And mid these dancing rocks at once and ever It flung up momently the sacred river. Five miles meandering with a mazy motion Through wood and dale the sacred river ran, Then reached the caverns measureless to man, And sank in tumult to a lifeless ocean And mid this tumult Kubla heard from far Ancestral voices prophesying war The shadow of the dome of pleasure Floated midway on the waves Where was heard the mingled measure From the fountain and the caves. It was a miracle of rare device, A sunny pleasure-dome with caves of ice A damsel with a dulcimer In a vision once I saw It was an Abyssinian maid, And on her dulcimer she played, Singing of Mount Abora. Could I revive within me Her symphony and song, To such a deep delight twould win me, That with music loud and long, I would build that dome in air, That sunny dome those caves of ice And all who heard should see them there, And all should cry, Beware Beware His flashing eyes, his floating hair Weave a circle round him thrice, And close your eyes with holy dread, For he on honey-dew hath fed, And drunk the milk of Paradise.\n",

            "Then said Almitra, Speak to us of Love. And he raised his head and looked upon the people, and there fell a stillness upon them. And with a great voice he said When love beckons to you, follow him, Though his ways are hard and steep. And when his wings enfold you yield to him, Though the sword hidden among his pinions may wound you. And when he speaks to you believe in him, Though his voice may shatter your dreams as the north wind lays waste the garden. For even as love crowns you so shall he crucify you. Even as he is for your growth so is he for your pruning. Even as he ascends to your height and caresses your tenderest branches that quiver in the sun, So shall he descend to your roots and shake them in their clinging to the earth. Like sheaves of corn he gathers you unto himself He threshes you to make your naked. He sifts you to free you from your husks. He grinds you to whiteness. He kneads you until you are pliant And then he assigns you to his sacred fire, that you may become sacred bread for Gods sacred feast. All these things shall love do unto you that you may know the secrets of your heart, and in that knowledge become a fragment of Lifes heart. But if in your heart you would seek only loves peace and loves pleasure, Then it is better for you that you cover your nakedness and pass out of loves threshing-floor, Into the seasonless world where you shall laugh, but not all of your laughter, and weep, but not all of your tears. Love gives naught but itself and takes naught but from itself. Love possesses not nor would it be possessed For love is sufficient unto love. When you love you should not say, God is in my heart, but rather, I am in the heart of God. And think not you can direct the course of love, for love, if it finds you worthy, directs your course. Love has no other desire but to fulfil itself. But if you love and must needs have desires, let these be your desires To melt and be like a running brook that sings its melody to the night. To know the pain of too much tenderness. To be wounded by your own understanding of love And to bleed willingly and joyfully. To wake at dawn with a winged heart and give thanks for another day of loving To rest at the noon hour and meditate loves ecstasy To return home at eventide with gratitude And then to sleep with a prayer for the beloved in your heart and a song of praise upon your lips.\n",

            "I have a rendezvous with Death At some disputed barricade, When Spring comes back with rustling shade And apple-blossoms fill the air I have a rendezvous with Death When Spring brings back blue days and fair. It may be he shall take my hand And lead me into his dark land And close my eyes and quench my breath It may be I shall pass him still. I have a rendezvous with Death On some scarred slope of battered hill, When Spring comes round again this year And the first meadow-flowers appear. God knows twere better to be deep Pillowed in silk and scented down, Where love throbs out in blissful sleep, Pulse nigh to pulse, and breath to breath, Where hushed awakenings are dear... But Ive a rendezvous with Death At midnight in some flaming town, When Spring trips north again this year, And I to my pledged word am true, I shall not fail that rendezvous.\n",

            "Then a woman said, Speak to us of Joy and Sorrow. And he answered Your joy is your sorrow unmasked. And the selfsame well from which your laughter rises was oftentimes filled with your tears. And how else can it be The deeper that sorrow carves into your being, the more joy you can contain. Is not the cup that holds your wine the very cup that was burned in the potters oven And is not the lute that soothes your spirit, the very wood that was hollowed with knives When you are joyous, look deep into your heart and you shall find it is only that which has given you sorrow that is giving you joy. When you are sorrowful look again in your heart, and you shall see that in truth you are weeping for that which has been your delight. Some of you say, Joy is greater than sorrow, and others say, Nay, sorrow is the greater. But I say unto you, they are inseparable. Together they come, and when one sits alone with you at your board, remember that the other is asleep upon your bed. Verily you are suspended like scales between your sorrow and your joy. Only when you are empty are you at standstill and balanced. When the treasure-keeper lifts you to weigh his gold and his silver, needs must your joy or your sorrow rise or fall.\n",

            "More than the fuchsia funnels breaking out of the crabapple tree, more than the neighbors almost obscene display of cherry limbs shoving their cotton candy-colored blossoms to the slate sky of Spring rains, its the greening of the trees that really gets to me. When all the shock of white and taffy, the worlds baubles and trinkets, leave the pavement strewn with the confetti of aftermath, the leaves come. Patient, plodding, a green skin growing over whatever winter did to us, a return to the strange idea of continuous living despite the mess of us, the hurt, the empty. Fine then, Ill take it, the tree seems to say, a new slick leaf unfurling like a fist to an open palm, Ill take it all.\n",

            "Where dips the rocky highland Of Sleuth Wood in the lake, There lies a leafy island Where flapping herons wake The drowsy water rats There we've hid our faery vats, Full of berrys And of reddest stolen cherries. Come away, O human child To the waters and the wild With a faery, hand in hand, For the world's more full of weeping than you can understand. Where the wave of moonlight glosses The dim gray sands with light, Far off by furthest Rosses We foot it all the night, Weaving olden dances Mingling hands and mingling glances Till the moon has taken flight To and fro we leap And chase the frothy bubbles, While the world is full of troubles And anxious in its sleep. Come away, O human child To the waters and the wild With a faery, hand in hand, For the world's more full of weeping than you can understand. Where the wandering water gushesFrom the hills above Glen-Car,In pools among the rushesThat scarce could bathe a star,We seek for slumbering troutAnd whispering in their earsGive them unquiet dreamsLeaning softly outFrom ferns that drop their tearsOver the young streams.Come away, O human childTo the waters and the wildWith a faery, hand in hand,For the world's more full of weeping than you can understand. From the hills above Glen-Car, In pools among the rushes That scarce could bathe a star, We seek for slumbering trout And whispering in their ears Give them unquiet dreams Leaning softly out From ferns that drop their tears Over the young streams. Come away, O human child To the waters and the wild With a faery, hand in hand, For the world's more full of weeping than you can understand. Away with us he's going, The solemn-eyed He'll hear no more the lowing Of the calves on the warm hillside Or the kettle on the hob Sing peace into his breast, Or see the brown mice bob Round and round the oatmeal chest. For he comes, the human child, To the waters and the wild With a faery, hand in hand, For the world's more full of weeping than he can understand.\n",

Over there, framed by a branch You can see a little patch of dark blue Stung by a sinister star that fades With faint quiverings, so small and white... June nights SeventeenDrink it in. Sap is champagne, it goes to your head... The mind wanders, you feel a kiss On your lips, quivering like a living thing... III. The wild heart Crusoes through a thousand novels And when a young girl walks alluringly Through a streetlamp's pale light, beneath the ominous shadow Of her father's starched collar... Because as she passes by, boot heels tapping, She turns on a dime, eyes wide, Finding you too sweet to resist... And cavatinas die on your lips. IV. You're in love. Off the market till August. You're in love.Your sonnets make Her laugh. Your friends are gone, you're bad news. Then, one night, your beloved, writes... That night...you return to the blinding cafés You order beer or lemonade... No one's serious at seventeen When lindens line the promenade.\n",

            "I cannot hold my peace, John Keats There never was a spring like this It is an echo, that repeats My last year's song and next year's bliss. I know, in spite of all men say Of Beauty, you have felt her most. Yea, even in your grave her way Is laid. Poor, troubled, lyric ghost, Spring never was so fair and dear As Beauty makes her seem this year. I cannot hold my peace, John Keats, I am as helpless in the toil Of Spring as any lamb that bleats To feel the solid earth recoil Beneath his puny legs. Spring beats Her tocsin call to those who love her, And lo the dogwood petals cover Her breast with drifts of snow, and sleek White gulls fly screaming to her, and hover About her shoulders, and kiss her cheek, While white and purple lilacs muster A strength that bears them to a cluster Of color and odor for her sake All things that slept are now awake. And you and I, shall we lie still, John Keats, while Beauty summons us Somehow I feel your sensitive will Is pulsing up some tremulous Sap road of a maple tree, whose leaves Grow music as they grow, since your Wild voice is in them, a harp that grieves For life that opens death's dark door. Though dust, your fingers still can push The Vision Splendid to a birth, Though now they work as grass in the hush Of the night on the broad sweet page of the earth. John Keats is dead, they say, but I Who hear your full insistent cry In bud and blossom, leaf and tree, Know John Keats still writes poetry. And while my head is earthward bowed To read new life sprung from your shroud, Folks seeing me must think it strange That merely spring should so derange My mind. They do not know that you, John Keats, keep revel with me, too.\n",

It is in that thought that we collect ourselves, Out of all the indifferences, into one thing Within a single thing, a single shawl Wrapped tightly round us, since we are poor, a warmth, A light, a power, the miraculous influence. Here, now, we forget each other and ourselves. We feel the obscurity of an order, a whole, A knowledge, that which arranged the rendezvous. Within its vital boundary, in the mind. We say God and the imagination are one... How high that highest candle lights the dark. Out of this same light, out of the central mind, We make a dwelling in the evening air, In which being there together is enough.\n",

Therefore, Jew, Though justice be thy plea, consider this, That, in the course of justice, none of us Should see salvation we do pray for mercy And that same prayer doth teach us all to render The deeds of mercy.

They ripple tensely, they can hardly contain their happiness That we have come. They bow shyly as wet swans. They love each other. There is no loneliness like theirs. At home once more, They begin munching the young tufts of spring in the darkness. I would like to hold the slenderer one in my arms, For she has walked over to me And nuzzled my left hand. She is black and white, Her mane falls wild on her forehead, And the light breeze moves me to caress her long ear That is delicate as the skin over a girls wrist. Suddenly I realize That if I stepped out of my body I would break Into blossom.\n",

At first, the infant, Mewling and puking in the nurse's arms. Then the whining schoolboy, with his satchel And shining morning face, creeping like snail Unwillingly to school. And then the lover, Sighing like furnace, with a woeful ballad Made to his mistress' eyebrow. Then a soldier, Full of strange oaths and bearded like the pard, Jealous in honor, sudden and quick in quarrel, Seeking the bubble reputation Even in the cannon's mouth. And then the justice, In fair round belly with good capon lined, With eyes severe and beard of formal cut, Full of wise saws and modern instances And so he plays his part. The sixth age shifts Into the lean and slippered pantaloon, With spectacles on nose and pouch on side His youthful hose, well saved, a world too wide For his shrunk shank, and his big manly voice, Turning again toward childish treble, pipes And whistles in his sound. Last scene of all, That ends this strange eventful history, Is second childishness and mere oblivion, Sans teeth, sans eyes, sans taste, sans everything.\n",

Thy love is such I can no way repay The heavens reward thee manifold, I pray. Then while we live, in love lets so persever, That when we live no more we may live ever.\n",

            "Take this kiss upon the brow And, in parting from you now, Thus much let me avow You are not wrong who deem That my days have been a dream Yet if hope has flown away In a night, or in a day, In a vision, or in none, Is it therefore the less gone All that we see or seem Is but a dream within a dream. I stand amid the roar Of a surf-tormented shore, And I hold within my hand Grains of the golden sand-- How few yet how they creep Through my fingers to the deep, While I weep--while I weep O God can I not grasp Them with a tighter clasp O God can I not save One from the pitiless wave Is all that we see or seem But a dream within a dream\n",

Admirer as I think I am Of stars that do not give a damn, I cannot, now I see them, say I missed one terribly all day. Were all stars to disappear or die, I should learn to look at an empty sky And feel its total dark sublime, Though this might take me a little time.\n",

            "It little profits that an idle king, By this still hearth, among these barren crags, Matched with an aged wife, I mete and dole Unequal laws unto a savage race, That hoard, and sleep, and feed, and know not me. I cannot rest from travel I will drink Life to the lees. All times I have enjoyed Greatly, have suffered greatly, both with those That loved me, and alone on shore, and when Through scudding drifts the rainy Hyades Vext the dim sea. I am become a name For always roaming with a hungry heart Much have I seen and knowncities of men And manners, climates, councils, governments, Myself not least, but honored of them all, And drunk delight of battle with my peers, Far on the ringing plains of windy Troy. I am a part of all that I have met Yet all experience is an arch wherethrough Gleams that untraveled world whose margin fades For ever and for ever when I move. How dull it is to pause, to make an end, To rust unburnished, not to shine in use As though to breathe were life Life piled on life Were all too little, and of one to me Little remains but every hour is saved From that eternal silence, something more, A bringer of new things and vile it were For some three suns to store and hoard myself, And this gray spirit yearning in desire To follow knowledge like a sinking star, Beyond the utmost bound of human thought. This is my son, mine own Telemachus, To whom I leave the scepter and the isle, Well-loved of me, discerning to fulfill This labor, by slow prudence to make mild A rugged people, and through soft degrees Subdue them to the useful and the good. Most blameless is he, centered in the sphere Of common duties, decent not to fail In offices of tenderness, and pay Meet adoration to my household gods, When I am gone. He works his work, I mine. There lies the port the vessel puffs her sail There gloom the dark, broad seas. My mariners, Souls that have toiled, and wrought, and thought with me, That ever with a frolic welcome took The thunder and the sunshine, and opposed Free hearts, free foreheadsyou and I are old Old age hath yet his honor and his toil. Death closes all but something ere the end, Some work of noble note, may yet be done, Not unbecoming men that strove with gods. The lights begin to twinkle from the rocks The long day wanes the slow moon climbs the deep Moans round with many voices. Come, my friends, 'Tis not too late to seek a newer world. Push off, and sitting well in order smite The sounding furrows for my purpose holds To sail beyond the sunset, and the baths Of all the western stars, until I die. It may be that the gulfs will wash us down It may be we shall touch the Happy Isles, And see the great Achilles, whom we knew. Though much is taken, much abides and though We are not now that strength which in old days Moved earth and heaven, that which we are, we are, One equal temper of heroic hearts, Made weak by time and fate, but strong in will To strive, to seek, to find, and not to yield.\n",

Otherwise this stone would seem defaced beneath the translucent cascade of the shoulders and would not glisten like a wild beasts fur would not, from all the borders of itself, burst like a star for here there is no place that does not see you.

            "My wild grief didnt know where to end.Everywhere I looked a field alive and unburied. Whole swaths of green swallowed the light. All around me, the field was growing. I grew out My hair in every direction. Let the sun freckle my face. Even in the greenest depths, I crouched Towards the light. That summer, everything grew So alive and so alone. A world hushed in green. Wildest grief grew inside out. I crawled to the fields edge, bruises blooming In every crevice of my palms. I didnt know Id reached a shoreline till I felt it There A salt wind lifted The hair from my neck. At the edge of every green lies an ocean. When I saw that blue, I knew then This world will end. Grief is not the only geography I know. Every wound closes. Repair comes with sweetness, Come spring. Every empire will fall I must believe this. I felt it Somewhere in the field my ancestors Murmuring Go home, go homesoon, soon. No country wants me back anymore and Im okay. If grief is love with nowhere to go, then Oh, Ive loved so immensely. That summer, everything I touched Was green. All bruises will fade From green and blue to skin. Let me grow through this green And not drown in it. Let me be lawless and beloved, Ungovernable and unafraid. Let me be brave enough to live here. Let me be precise in my actions. Let me feel hurt. I know I can heal. Let me try againagain and again.

            "Theres a poem in this place in the footfalls in the halls in the quiet beat of the seats. It is here, at the curtain of day, where America writes a lyric you must whisper to say. Theres a poem in this place in the heavy grace, the lined face of this noble building, collections burned and reborn twice. Theres a poem in Bostons Copley Square where protest chants tear through the air like sheets of rain, where love of the many swallows hatred of the few. Theres a poem in Charlottesville where tiki torches string a ring of flame tight round the wrist of night where men so white they gleam blue seem like statues where men heap that long wax burning ever higher where Heather Heyer blooms forever in a meadow of resistance. Theres a poem in the great sleeping giant of Lake Michigan, defiantly raising its big blue head to Milwaukee and Chicago a poem begun long ago, blazed into frozen soil, strutting upward and aglow. Theres a poem in Florida, in East Texas where streets swell into a nexus of rivers, cows afloat like mottled buoys in the brown, where courage is now so common that 23-year-old Jesus Contreras rescues people from floodwaters. Theres a poem in Los Angeles yawning wide as the Pacific tide where a single mother swelters in a windowless classroom, teaching black and brown students in Watts to spell out their thoughts so her daughter might write this poem for you. There's a lyric in California where thousands of students march for blocks, undocumented and unafraid where my friend Rosa finds the power to blossom in deadlock, her spirit the bedrock of her community. She knows hope is like a stubborn ship gripping a dock, a truth that you cant stop a dreamer or knock down a dream. How could this not be her city su nación our country our America, our American lyric to write a poem by the people, the poor, the Protestant, the Muslim, the Jew, the native, the immigrant, the black, the brown, the blind, the brave, the undocumented and undeterred, the woman, the man, the nonbinary, the white, the trans, the ally to all of the above and more Tyrants fear the poet. Now that we know it we cant blow it. We owe it to show it not slow it although it hurts to sew it when the world skirts below it. Hope we must bestow it like a wick in the poet so it can grow, lit, bringing with it stories to rewrite the story of a Texas city depleted but not defeated a history written that need not be repeated a nation composed but not yet completed. Theres a poem in this place a poem in America a poet in every American who rewrites this nation, who tells a story worthy of being told on this minnow of an earth to breathe hope into a palimpsest of time a poet in every American who sees that our poem penned doesnt mean our poems end. Theres a place where this poem dwells it is here, it is now, in the yellow song of dawns bell where we write an American lyric we are just beginning to tell.\n",

            "And a man said, Speak to us of Self-Knowledge. And he answered, saying Your hearts know in silence the secrets of the days and the nights. But your ears thirst for the sound of your hearts knowledge. You would know in words that which you have always known in thought. You would touch with your fingers the naked body of your dreams. And it is well you should. The hidden well-spring of your soul must needs rise and run murmuring to the sea And the treasure of your infinite depths would be revealed to your eyes. But let there be no scales ot weigh your unknown treasure And seek not the depths of your knowledge with staff or sounding line. For self is a sea boundless and measureless. Say not, I have found the truth, but rather, I have found a truth. Say not, I have found the path of the soul. Say rather, I have met the soul walking upon my path. For the soul walks upon all paths. The soul walks not upon a line, neither does it grow like a reed. The soul unfolds itself, like a lotus of countless petals.\n",

            "When the doctor suggested surgery and a brace for all my youngest years, my parents scrambled to take me to massage therapy, deep tissue work, osteopathy, and soon my crooked spine unspooled a bit, I could breathe again, and move more in a body unclouded by pain. My mom would tell me to sing songs to her the whole forty-five minute drive to Middle Two Rock Road and forty- five minutes back from physical therapy. Shed say, even my voice sounded unfettered by my spine afterward. So I sang and sang, because I thought she liked it. I never asked her what she gave up to drive me, or how her day was before this chore. Today, at her age, I was driving myself home from yet another spine appointment, singing along to some maudlin but solid song on the radio, and I saw a mom take her raincoat off and give it to her young daughter when a storm took over the afternoon. My god, I thought, my whole life Ive been under her raincoat thinking it was somehow a marvel that I never got wet.\n"

And yet, through the gloom and the light,\\nThe fate of a nation was riding that night;\\nAnd the spark struck out by that steed, in his flight,\\nKindled the land into flame with its heat.\\nHe has left the village and mounted the steep,\\nAnd beneath him, tranquil and broad and deep,\\nIs the Mystic, meeting the ocean tides;\\nAnd under the alders, that skirt its edge,\\nNow soft on the sand, now loud on the ledge,\\nIs heard the tramp of his steed as he rides.\\nIt was twelve by the village clock\\nWhen he crossed the bridge into Medford town.\\nHe heard the crowing of the cock,\\nAnd the barking of the farmer\\u2019s dog,\\nAnd felt the damp of the river-fog,\\nThat rises when the sun goes down.\\nIt was one by the village clock,\\nWhen he galloped into Lexington.\\nHe saw the gilded weathercock\\nSwim in the moonlight as he passed,\\nAnd the meeting-house windows, blank and bare,\\nGaze at him with a spectral glare,\\nAs if they already stood aghast\\nAt the bloody work they would look upon.\\nIt was two by the village clock,\\nWhen he came to the bridge in Concord town.\\nHe heard the bleating of the flock,\\nAnd the twitter of birds among the trees,\\nAnd felt the breath of the morning breeze\\nBlowing over the meadows brown.\\nAnd one was safe and asleep in his bed\\nWho at the bridge would be first to fall,\\nWho that day would be lying dead,\\nPierced by a British musket-ball.\\nYou know the rest.
